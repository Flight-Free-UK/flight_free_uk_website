  - bio: Behaviour change specialist Anna has worked in sustainable transport since
      2008, at first focussing on bikes with Sustrans, and now on aviation with
      Flight Free UK. A lifelong environmentalist, she stopped flying more than
      15 years ago. A favourite flight-free trip was cycling the length of
      France to swim in the Mediterranean at Nice – returning by train rather
      than cycle home!

    bio: Originally from Essex, Ella is now studying Environmental Science at the
      University of Exeter. Her work with the Royal Parks, the Cornish Wildlife
      Trust and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust has given her an enthusiasm for
      conservation and biodiversity (and a love for bees – probably the world's
      most climate-friendly flyers!). Her dream flight-free trip would be
      city-hopping around Spain.
