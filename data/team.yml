      focussing on increasing cycling levels with children and families. A
      lifelong environmentalist, she made the decision to stop flying ten years

      A photography graduate, Alice is part of our media team, creating and
      producing visual resources for the campaign. She’s keen to show that we
      can have great holidays without flying and even though we as individuals
      can’t change the world, when we work together we can have a real impact.

      Jo manages our Edinburgh team. It was a recent flight to Peru that woke
      her up to the climate impact of flying, and she decided then and there to
      stop (once getting home of course!) Jo is passionate about reducing her
      carbon footprint and encouraging others to do the same.
