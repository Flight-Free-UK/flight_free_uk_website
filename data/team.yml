  - name: Amy Morgan
    bio: Geography graduate Amy lives in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Her degree
      programme focused heavily on social justice and environmental change,
      which encouraged her to make personal changes and explore other
      sustainability initiatives. Volunteering with Flight Free UK is a perfect
      fit to encourage others to make eco-friendly choices too. Amy says, “I’d
      love to see the Northern Lights, so taking the ferry/train to Northern
      Scandinavia would definitely be a dream trip!”

  - bio: Behaviour change specialist Anna has worked in the sustainable transport
      sector since 2008, at first increasing cycling levels among children and
      families with Sustrans, and now encouraging people to reduce the amount
      they fly with Flight Free UK. A lifelong environmentalist, she made the
      decision to stop flying more than ten years ago. A favourite flight-free
      trip was cycling the length of France to swim in the Mediterranean at
      Nice. She then returned by train rather than cycle home!

    role: Admin
    bio: Gemma lives in South East London and works for Amnesty International, whose
      focus includes campaigning for climate justice in countries most affected
      by climate change. As someone who has always volunteered throughout their
      working life, including for the Green Party, volunteering for Flight Free
      UK mixes a passion for overland travel with a passion for sustainability.
      Gemma also picked the Northern Lights as their dream flight-free trip, but
      a close second comes the Trans Siberian railway – while wishing for peace
      in that region.
