      Anna has worked in the sustainable transport sector since 2008, mainly
      focussing on increasing cycling levels with children and families. A
      lifelong environmentalist, she made the decision to stop flying ten years
      ago and hopes the #flightfree2020 campaign will inspire others to do the
      same.

      A photography graduate, Alice is part of our media team, creating and
      producing visual resources for the campaign. She’s keen to show that we
      can have great holidays without flying and even though we as individuals
      can’t change the world, when we work together we can have a real impact.

      Maria lives in San Sebastian in northern Spain, and stopped flying several
      years ago because of concern for the type of world her son would inherit.
      She now travels by train to see family and friends in Buckinghamshire, and
      manages our Facebook page.
