      2008, at first focussing on bikes with Sustrans, and now on aviation with
      Flight Free UK. A lifelong environmentalist, she stopped flying more than
      15 years ago. A favourite flight-free trip was cycling the length of
      France to swim in the Mediterranean at Nice – returning by train rather
      than cycle home!

      exploring the wonderful nature we have in the UK, as well as travelling
