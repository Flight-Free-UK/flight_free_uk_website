  - bio: Behaviour change specialist Anna has worked in sustainable transport since
      2008, at first focussing on bikes with Sustrans, and now on aviation with
      Flight Free UK. A lifelong environmentalist, she stopped flying more than
      ten years ago. A favourite flight-free trip was cycling the length of
      France to swim in the Mediterranean at Nice – returning by train rather
      than cycle home!

      as their dream flight-free trip, but a close second comes the Trans
      Siberian railway – while wishing for peace in that region.
