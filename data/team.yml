  - name: Amy Morgan

      focused on social justice and environmental change, which encouraged her
      to make personal changes and help others to make eco-friendly choices too.
      Amy says, “I’d love to see the Northern Lights, so taking the ferry/train
      to Northern Scandinavia would be a dream trip!”

  - bio: Behaviour change specialist Anna has worked in sustainable transport since
      2008, moving from cycling with Sustrans, to aviation with Flight Free UK.
      A lifelong environmentalist, she made the decision to stop flying more
      than ten years ago. A favourite flight-free trip was cycling the length of
      France to swim in the Mediterranean at Nice – returning by train rather
      than cycle home!
