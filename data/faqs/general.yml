  - question: Why should we worry about flying?
    answer: >-
      If you fly, those flights make up the most significant part of your
      carbon footprint. Depending on where you go, one flight can double your carbon
      output for the year. To put it in context, one transatlantic flight generates
      more CO2 than eating meat for a year, or a year’s worth of driving, and more
      than a resident of India will in an entire year.
  - question: The aviation industry only contributes 3% of global emissions so it can’t be that bad, can it?
    answer: >-
      While making up only a small portion of global emissions, aviation is the
      sector that is set to expand the fastest, with predictions of it reaching 10%
      by 2030. The transport sector as a whole is only responsible for 15% of global
      emissions, so that’s quite a large chunk! In addition, less than 10% of the
      world’s population has ever been on a plane, which accounts for the small
      percentage. But if you are one of those who do fly, those flights make up the
      largest part of your carbon footprint.
