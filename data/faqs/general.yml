      If you fly, those flights make up the most significant part of your carbon
      footprint. Depending on where you go, one flight can double your carbon
      output for the year. To put it in context, one transatlantic flight
      generates more CO2 than eating meat for a year, or a year’s worth of
      driving, and more than a resident of India will in an entire year.
    question: Why should we worry about flying?

      While making up only a small portion of global emissions, aviation is the
      sector that is set to expand the fastest, with predictions of it reaching
      10% by 2030. The transport sector as a whole is only responsible for 15%
      of global emissions, so that’s quite a large chunk! In addition, less than
      10% of the world’s population has ever been on a plane, which accounts for
      the small percentage. But if you are one of those who do fly, those
      flights make up the largest part of your carbon footprint.
    question: >-
      The aviation industry only contributes 3% of global emissions so it can’t
      be that bad, can it?

      Flying business class is approximately three times more carbon heavy than
      flying economy class. This is because business class takes up more space,
      so each person accounts for a greater proportion of the plane’s emissions.
      (So if you do fly, it should always be in economy class.)\

      \

      However, business flights make up a relatively small percentage of total
      flights taken each year. In 2017, only 9% of UK flights were work-related,
      whereas 64% were for holidays (ref: ONS)
    question: >-
      Isn’t it those businessmen flying for work all the time who are
      responsible for most of the emissions?
  - answer: >-
      Green fuel, or bio fuel, takes land space to grow, and biofuel plantations
      are a significant driver of deforestation. So while burning biofuel
      produces fewer greenhouse gasses than burning kerosene, the process of
      generating many biofuels is highly destructive.


      The technology for viable electric flights is still many years away –
      battery size, efficiency and range are all issues that need to be
      addressed to make electric flights commercially viable. And producing
      electricity (and lithium batteries) is not without environmental impact.
    question: What about green fuel and electric flights?

      Being vegan is an excellent way of reducing your environmental impact, as
      a plant-based diet requires a fraction of the resources in terms of land
      use and water than a meat-based diet. In terms of carbon footprint,
      however, while being vegan can save one ton of CO2 per year, you could use
      that up in a single flight.
    question: Isn't being vegan more effective than stopping flying?

      System change is essential for making the large scale shifts that we need
      to be sustainable. However, individual change can lead to system change.
      The government will be more likely to implement changes if they can see
      there is a public demand for it.
    question: ' Why do I have to change? Shouldn’t it be up to the government?'
  - answer: >-
      Not at all! Travel is still possible (and in many cases, far more
      enjoyable) without flying. Go to our Blog page for inspiration and ideas.
    question: Does this mean I can't go on holiday?
  - answer: >-
      One of the reasons that flying is comparatively cheap is that there is no
      tax on aviation fuel. This is because of an international agreement made
      in 1944 by which it was agreed to keep kerosene tax-free in order to give
      a boost to the fledgling aviation industry. The agreement has never been
      overturned. ​


      The hard truth is, there's no such thing as a cheap flight – someone
      always pays, and that's currently those living with the effects of climate
      change.
    question: So why is flying so cheap?

      Carbon offsetting is when you pay money to schemes whose activities absorb
      the equivalent CO2 to what your flight produces, e.g. by planting trees.
      Most carbon offsetting schemes have been shown to be ineffective in terms
      of their ability to absorb the necessary carbon, or they simply pay into
      existing schemes which don't actually compensate for your flight. In any
      case, there is not enough space on the planet to plant enough trees to
      make up for all the flights that take off each day. ​


      In addition, carbon offset schemes often mean that people feel that they
      have dealt with the impact of their flight, so they continue to fly. The
      best way to offset carbon emissions is to not produce them in the first
      place.
    question: What about carbon offsetting?

      Flights work on a supply and demand basis. You just have to look at the
      weekends with international sporting fixtures to see the extra flights
      laid on to cope with demand. In the long term, lower demand leads to less
      supply. We are already seeing this in Sweden, where the no-fly movement
      has been longest established – in the early part of 2019 flight bookings
      were down and rail bookings were up.
    question: The plane will take off anyway so there’s no point in me not flying
  - answer: >-
      Not flying doesn’t mean not travelling (see our Blog for tales of
      flight-free travels) so there is still plenty of opportunity to support
      international tourism without flying. However, many countries are now
      suffering from over-tourism (e.g. Bali and New Zealand) while our own
      tourism industry here in the UK is struggling. Supporting our local
      tourism industry is just as worthwhile as supporting that in Laos.  


      In addition, the aviation sector is not the only industry that provides
      jobs. Expanded rail travel, for example, could provide equivalent
      employment opportunities.
    question: What about global tourism and the jobs involved with aviation?
