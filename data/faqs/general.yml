      Taking a flight is one of the most high-carbon activities we can do. Not
      everybody flies, but for those who do, flights will make up the most
      significant part of your carbon footprint. To put it in context, one
      return transatlantic flight generates more CO2 per passenger than [eating
      meat for a year, or driving for a year](/why_flight_free). 


      At at time where scientists tell us we must dramatically cut our carbon output, the aviation industry has plans to grow and expand. It is much easier to decarbonise other sectors such as heating and road transport than it will be to decarbonise aviation. Many flights are non-essential, so addressing how much we fly is a key part of facing the climate emergency.
    question: Why should we worry about flying?
  - answer: >-
      Taking into consideration radiative forcing (high-altitude emissions) and
      non-CO2 effects (including water vapour contrails), aviation is
      responsible for about [3.5% of global climate change
      emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation). 


      But that's not because emissions from aviation are low, it's because, globally, very few people actually fly: less than [20% of the world’s population](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-aviation) has ever been on a plane. Here in the west, where we fly a lot, flights make up the largest part of our carbon footprints.
    question: The aviation industry only contributes 2% of global emissions so it
      can’t be that bad, can it?
  - answer: >-
      Interestingly, business flights only account for around [10% of the
      flights we take](/post/lets-get-down-to-business/), and this hasn't
      changed much in the past few years. In our new virtual world and the
      impact of Covid-19, that number is likely to drop further. 


      The majority of flights (63%) are for holidays with a quarter of flights being to visit family and friends.


      It is true, however, that flying business class is approximately three times more carbon heavy than flying economy class, because business class seats take up more space, so each person accounts for a greater proportion of the plane’s emissions.
    question: Isn’t it business flights that are responsible for most of the emissions?
  - answer: >-
      It’s easy to pin our hopes on techno-fixes for aviation, but we’ll be
      waiting for a long time for it to make an impact on emissions. The first
      electric or hydrogen-powered flights won’t be commercially available until
      at least 2035, and we need to be reducing emissions now. 


      Electric aircraft would only be viable for short haul travel, and there is still an environmental impact in creating batteries and generating the electricity needed to charge them.


      Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF often uses biofuels, a key driver of deforestation, and synthetic fuels use fossil fuels in the making process.
    question: What about green fuel and electric flights?

      Being vegan is an excellent way of reducing your environmental impact, as
      a plant-based diet uses a fraction of the resources in terms of land use
      and water than a meat-based diet. 


      In terms of carbon output, while being vegan can save around 1.5 tonnes CO2 per year, you could use that up in a single flight.
    question: Isn't being vegan more effective than stopping flying?

      System change is essential for making the large scale shifts that we
      desperately need to see. However, it's never one or the other. Our
      individual actions can influence the system, especially if lots of us do
      it together. 


      Governments and industry respond to public opinion and consumer behaviour, so if we demonstrate with our actions that we don’t want to fly, we can influence policy.
    question: " Why do I have to change? Shouldn’t it be up to the government?"
  - answer: Not at all! Travel is still possible (and in many cases, far more
      enjoyable) without flying. Our [How to pages](/how_to) are
      packed full with inspiring stories of overland travel to destinations near
      and far.
    question: Does this mean I can't go on holiday?
  - answer: >-
      It’s true that there are some eye-wateringly low prices out there. One of
      the reasons is that there’s [no tax on aviation
      fuel](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00523/SN00523.pdf),
      giving flights an unfair advantage over other forms of transport. However,
      it is possible to find cheap rail fares, especially on the continent, and
      often the price of your air fare starts to escalate once you factor in
      transfers and luggage allowance etc.


      If flights were taxed fairly, and rail travel given more support, it would be much easier to choose low-carbon transport.
    question: But flying is so cheap!

      Many airlines offer carbon offsetting as standard, and claim to therefore
      be ‘carbon neutral’. Unfortunately this is a bit too good to be true. A
      2017 study showed that the majority of carbon offsetting schemes [didn’t
      absorb the necessary
      carbon](https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/carbon-offsets), and while
      there are some gold-standard schemes out there, most of them rely on
      future carbon absorption (i.e. through planting trees), whereas flying
      emits carbon now.


      In addition, carbon offset schemes often mean that people feel that they have dealt with the impact of their flight, so they continue to fly. The best way to offset carbon emissions is not to produce them in the first place.
    question: What about carbon offsetting?

      Flights work on a supply and demand basis. Nowhere has this been more
      keenly felt than during Covid-19 when people stopped flying, so planes
      stayed grounded. 


      In the short term, your decision not to take a flight might not ground that particular plane, but in the longer term, lower demand leads to less supply. In Sweden, where the no-fly movement has been longest established, flight bookings fell by 9% in 2019 and rail bookings were up.
    question: The plane will take off anyway so there’s no point in me not flying
  - answer: >-
      Not flying doesn’t mean not travelling (see our [How to
      pages](/how_to) for tales of flight-free travels) so there is still
      plenty of opportunity to support international tourism without flying.
      However, we musn’t forget that many countries suffer from over-tourism
      (e.g. Bali and New Zealand) while our own tourism industry here in the UK
      is struggling. Supporting our local tourism industry is just as
      worthwhile.


      In addition, the aviation sector is not the only industry that provides jobs. Expanded rail travel and engineering in renewable technology, for example, could provide equivalent employment opportunities.
    question: What about global tourism and the jobs involved with aviation?
