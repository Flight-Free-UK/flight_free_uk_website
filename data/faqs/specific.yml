  - answer: We want everyone who can to be completely flight free in 2021,  but for
      those who might not be able to be flight free for work or family reasons
      there is an option to pledge not to fly for leisure in 2021.  And for
      those who are further along their flight free journey, there's the option
      to stay grounded for life.
    question: Why three different pledge options?
  - question: What do you mean by leisure flights?
    answer: >-
      We categorise leisure flights as those taken purely for holidays. Work
      trips and visits to see family and friends are counted separately. 


      We use the categories defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS): leisure, family and friends, and work.
  - question: Can I change my pledge category?
    answer: You can change your pledge category by signing the pledge again with the
      same email address and name that you used the first time, but with your
      new category choice. The database will be updated to reflect your new
      category.
  - answer: Asking people to stop flying forever is unlikely to appeal. But a flight
      free year can be a good way to break an established habit and enable
      people to start to see other alternatives. Having a time limit focuses the
      pledge as well as makes it an achievable aim. Committing to something in
      the short term increases the chances of longer-term behavioural change.
    question: Why only for a year?
  - answer: >-
      Flight Free UK is part of an international community of flight-free
      movements. Each country is different, with different social and political
      attitudes towards flying, and we take care to ensure our communications
      and messaging relate to the situation we have here in the UK. We aim to
      build a community of people who feel united about an issue, and we will
      have a more compelling voice with government if our signatories are all UK
      residents.


      However, anyone can take the pledge from anywhere in the world by selecting their own country from the drop-down menu. We send monthly updates to our international pledgers as well as sending a monthly newsletter to our UK pledgers.
    question: Why UK only?
  - question: What if there's an emergency and I have to fly?
    answer: If an emergency situation arises, of course we understand that you would
      have to break your pledge.
  - answer: It’s true that many other countries are far more polluting than the UK.
      But in terms of aviation, Brits take more flights than in any other nation
      in the world. It is also far easier to guide and influence other countries
      and regimes if you lead by example.
    question: Why aren't you focussing on the more polluting countries?
  - answer: Yes – anyone can take the pledge from anywhere in the world by selecting
      their own country from the drop-down menu. Your pledge will be counted
      towards the total of that country, and will also be counted towards the
      international total.
    question: If I don’t live in the UK can I still show my support?
  - answer: Yes. It is possible to register children and other close relatives who
      do not have their own email address by entering the same email address
      that you used.
    question: Can my children make the pledge?
  - answer: If you are interested in setting up your own campaign, please [get in
      touch](/contact_us). It's hard work but can be very rewarding to inspire
      your fellow countrymen to be flight free!
    question: Can I set up the campaign in my own country?
  - answer: Yes, please do! Your voice will give the campaign credence and will show
      others that there is a desire to take action on this issue. People are
      more willing to change their behaviour if others show they are willing to
      do the same, so your signature will encourage others to also take the
      pledge.
    question: I already don’t fly. Should I still sign up?
  - answer: Fewer flights is absolutely the aim of the campaign, and just reducing
      your flying by one flight per year can substantially lower your carbon
      output. However, for this particular campaign we are asking people to
      abstain completely for one year. This is partly because of the fragile
      state of our climate and the need to take immediate and meaningful action,
      but it’s mostly to demonstrate that there are legitimate alternatives to
      flying. This challenge requires real commitment and, for some, a
      significant lifestyle change, which is more likely to promote greener
      transport choices in the future.
    question: Can’t I just fly less?
