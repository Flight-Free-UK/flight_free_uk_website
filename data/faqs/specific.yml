      The target of 100,000 makes our pledge about taking collective action.
      Often, we feel that our individual actions don’t make a difference, but
      when we see others making a change, we feel more inspired to make that
      change too. By taking part in our pledge, you know that you are one of
      100,000 people doing the same thing. 


      For some, our target is too small – approximately 100,000 flights globally
      take off every day. But the target needs to be achievable in order for the
      campaign to be a success. If we aim too high we are setting ourselves up
      to fail; however, if we can reach 100,000 people this year, we could
      establish a much bigger target in future years. 


      On the other hand, some say our target is too large – 100,000 people is an
      awful lot! But having a substantial target shows a determination to act on
      this issue, and we hope that such a target will galvanise people into
      taking action as well as attracting media attention.
    question: 'Why 100,000?'

      Asking people to stop flying forever is unlikely to appeal. But an
      air-free year can be a good way to break an established habit and enable
      people to start to see other alternatives. Having a time limit focuses the
      pledge as well as makes it an achievable aim. Commitment to something in
      the short term increases the chances of longer-term behavioural change.
    question: Why only for a year?
