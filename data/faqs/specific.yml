      The target of 100,000 makes our pledge about taking collective action.
      Often, we feel that our individual actions don’t make a difference, but
      when we see others making a change, we feel more inspired to make that
      change too. By taking part in our pledge, you know that you are one of
      100,000 people doing the same thing. 


      For some, our target is too small – approximately 100,000 flights globally
      take off every day. But the target needs to be achievable in order for the
      campaign to be a success. If we aim too high we are setting ourselves up
      to fail; however, if we can reach 100,000 people this year, we could
      establish a much bigger target in future years. 


      On the other hand, some say our target is too large – 100,000 people is an
      awful lot! But having a substantial target shows a determination to act on
      this issue, and we hope that such a target will galvanise people into
      taking action as well as attracting media attention.
    question: 'Why 100,000?'
  - answer: >-
      Asking people to stop flying forever is unlikely to appeal. But an
      air-free year can be a good way to break an established habit and enable
      people to start to see other alternatives. Having a time limit focuses the
      pledge as well as makes it an achievable aim. Commitment to something in
      the short term increases the chances of longer-term behavioural change.
    question: Why only for a year?
  - answer: >-
      Focussing on next year means that people will have time to make their
      flight-free plans, and we will have time to reach our target of 100,000.
      Of course, we want people to stop flying in 2019, 2021, 2022 etc, but
      having the year focus makes our campaign more of an ‘event’. Sort of like
      a Veganuary for aviation!
    question: Why 2020?
  - answer: >-
      Flight Free UK is part of an international community of flight-free
      movements. It started in Sweden in 2019 and has now expanded to countries
      across Europe as well as to the USA, Canada and Australia. Each country is
      different, with different social and political attitudes towards flying.
      We aim to grow a community of people who feel united about an issue, and
      we will have a more compelling voice with government if our signatories
      are all UK residents.
    question: Why UK only?
  - answer: >-
      It’s true that many other countries are far more polluting than the UK.
      But in terms of aviation, Brits take more flights than in any other nation
      in the world. It is also far easier to guide and influence other countries
      and regimes if you lead by example.  


      For example, in Sweden, where airlines are amongst the greenest in the
      world, the no-fly movement is influencing them to be even greener.
    question: Why aren't you focussing on the more polluting countries?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. When you sign up, select your country. Your pledge will be counted
      towards the total of that country, and will also be counted towards the
      international total.
    question: If I don’t live in the UK can I still show my support?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, absolutely! If you want to set up your own campaign, please get in
      touch.
    question: Can I set up my own campaign in my own country?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, please do! Your voice will give the campaign credence and will show
      others that there is a desire to take action on this issue. People are
      more willing to change their behaviour if others show they are willing to
      do the same, so your signature will hopefully encourage others to also
      take the pledge.
    question: I already don’t fly. Should I still sign up?
  - answer: >-
      Fewer flights is absolutely the aim of the campaign, and just reducing
      your flying by one flight per year can substantially lower your carbon
      output. However, for this particular campaign we are asking people to
      abstain completely for one year. This is partly because of the fragile
      state of our climate and the need to take immediate and meaningful action,
      but it’s mostly to demonstrate that there are legitimate alternatives to
      flying. This challenge requires real commitment and, for some, a
      significant lifestyle change, which is more likely to promote greener
      transport choices in the future.
    question: Can’t I just fly less?
