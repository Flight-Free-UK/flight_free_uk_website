  - question: Why are there different pledge options?
    answer: >-
      Our main pledge is for people to stay completely flight free for a year.
      This is our tried-and-tested method of behaviour change, and it's a great
      way to reduce emissions and try the alternatives.


      However, being completely flight free won't suit everybody, for example if you have work or family commitments. Offering a 'free choice' pledge means that you can choose something that suits your personal circumstances. This could be anything from not flying on holiday, to challenging yourself to a flight-free decade!
  - question: Can I choose anything for my custom pledge?
    answer: T﻿he 'free choice' pledge is designed so that you can pick whatever
      suits you. However, it still needs to be a challenge! We encourage you to
      choose something ambitious, given our fragile climate situation.
  - question: Can I change my pledge category?
    answer: You can change your pledge category by signing the pledge again with the
      same email address and name that you used the first time, but with your
      new category choice. The database will be updated to reflect your new
      category.
  - answer: Asking people to stop flying forever is unlikely to appeal. But a flight
      free year can be a good way to break an established habit and enable
      people to start to see other alternatives. Having a time limit focuses the
      pledge as well as makes it an achievable aim. Committing to something in
      the short term increases the chances of longer-term behavioural change.
    question: Why only for a year?
  - answer: >-
      Flight Free UK is part of an international community of flight-free
      movements. Each country is different, with different social and political
      attitudes towards flying, and we take care to ensure our communications
      and messaging relate to the travel and political situation we have here in
      the UK. We aim to build a community of people who feel united about an
      issue, and we will have a more compelling voice with government if our
      signatories are all UK residents.


      In practice, anyone can sign the pledge from anywhere in the world, but our focus is on the UK.
    question: Why UK only?
  - question: What if there's an emergency and I have to fly?
    answer: If an emergency situation arises, of course we understand that you would
      have to break your pledge.
  - answer: It’s true that many other countries are far more polluting than the UK.
      But in terms of aviation, Brits take more flights than in any other nation
      in the world. It is also far easier to guide and influence other countries
      and regimes if you lead by example.
    question: Why aren't you focussing on the more polluting countries?
  - answer: Yes. It is possible to register children and other close relatives who
      do not have their own email address by entering their name and the same
      email address that you used.
    question: Can my children make the pledge?
  - answer: If you are interested in setting up your own campaign, please [get in
      touch](/contact_us). It's hard work but can be very rewarding to inspire
      your fellow countrymen to be flight free!
    question: Can I set up the campaign in my own country?
  - answer: Yes, please do! Your voice will give the campaign credence and will show
      others that there is a desire to take action on this issue. People are
      more willing to change their behaviour if others show they are willing to
      do the same, so your signature will encourage others to also take the
      pledge.
    question: I already don’t fly. Should I still sign up?
  - answer: Fewer flights is absolutely the aim of the campaign, and just reducing
      your flying by one flight per year can substantially lower your carbon
      output. However, for this particular campaign we are asking people to
      abstain completely for one year (or make their own custom challenge). This
      is partly because of the fragile state of our climate and the need to take
      immediate and meaningful action, but it’s mostly to demonstrate that there
      are legitimate alternatives to flying. This challenge requires real
      commitment and, for some, a significant lifestyle change, which is more
      likely to promote greener transport choices in the future.
    question: Can’t I just fly less?
