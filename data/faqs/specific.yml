      Asking people to stop flying forever is unlikely to appeal. But an
      air-free year can be a good way to break an established habit and enable
      people to start to see other alternatives. Having a time limit focuses the
      pledge as well as makes it an achievable aim. Commitment to something in
      the short term increases the chances of longer-term behavioural change.
    question: Why only for a year?
  - answer: >-
      Flight Free UK is part of an international community of flight-free
      movements. It started in Sweden in 2019 and has now expanded to countries
      across Europe as well as to the USA and Australia. Each country is
      different, with different social and political attitudes towards flying.
      We aim to grow a community of people who feel united about an issue, and
      we will have a more compelling voice with government if our signatories
      are all UK residents.
    question: Why UK only?
  - answer: >-
      It’s true that many other countries are far more polluting than the UK.
      But in terms of aviation, Brits take more flights than in any other nation
      in the world. It is also far easier to guide and influence other countries
      and regimes if you lead by example.  


      For example, in Sweden, where airlines are amongst the greenest in the
      world, the no-fly movement is influencing them to be even greener.
    question: Why aren't you focussing on the more polluting countries?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. When you sign up, select your country. Your pledge will be counted
      towards the total of that country, and will also be counted towards the
      international total.
    question: If I don’t live in the UK can I still show my support?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, absolutely! If you want to set up your own campaign, please get in
      touch.
    question: Can I set up the campaign in my own country?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, please do! Your voice will give the campaign credence and will show
      others that there is a desire to take action on this issue. People are
      more willing to change their behaviour if others show they are willing to
      do the same, so your signature will encourage others to also take the
      pledge.
    question: I already don’t fly. Should I still sign up?
  - answer: >-
      Fewer flights is absolutely the aim of the campaign, and just reducing
      your flying by one flight per year can substantially lower your carbon
      output. However, for this particular campaign we are asking people to
      abstain completely for one year. This is partly because of the fragile
      state of our climate and the need to take immediate and meaningful action,
      but it’s mostly to demonstrate that there are legitimate alternatives to
      flying. This challenge requires real commitment and, for some, a
      significant lifestyle change, which is more likely to promote greener
      transport choices in the future.
    question: Can’t I just fly less?
