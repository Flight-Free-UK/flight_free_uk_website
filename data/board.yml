    bio: Teacher, Green Party councillor and one-time TV star James lives in
      Hertfordshire with his family. A keen cyclist and challenge-seeker, he has
      previously cycled through every English county using Sustrans trails, and
      he also holds the Guinness world record for the biggest blanket fort. His
      dream flight-free trip would (also) be to the far north of Norway to see
      the Northern Lights.

    bio: Born in England, brought up in Scotland and Wales, Maggie now lives in
      Bristol. She has a teenage son and is married to a polar scientist, which
      has made her deeply concerned about climate change. She has a Masterâ€™s
      degree in geography and is a former university manager with experience in
      strategic planning, resource allocation and risk management. She spent her
      honeymoon cycling in the Dordogne, and her dream flight-free trip would be
      to explore the Danube Delta by boat.

      orchestra, encouraging the musicians to travel by coach and train to gigs
