    bio: Teacher, Green Party councillor and one-time TV star James lives in
      Hertfordshire with his family. A keen cyclist and challenge-seeker, he has
      previously cycled through every English county using Sustrans trails, and
      he also holds the Guinness world record for the biggest blanket fort. His
      dream flight-free trip would (also) be to the far north of Norway to see
      the Northern Lights.

    bio: >
      Classical musician Lenny heads up the Green Team in his orchestra,
      encouraging the use of sustainable transport such as using the train to
      tour in Europe. His interest in low-carbon living means he takes his
      clarinets to work in his bicycle trailer. Lenny's dream flight-free trip
      would be to tour the Alps on his bicycle, perhaps even cycling all the way
      there through the Netherlands and down the Rhine through Germany. He did
      this with his dad when he was 15 and would love to go back.

    bio: Born in England, brought up in Scotland and Wales, Maggie now lives in
      Cornwall. She has a teenage son and is married to a polar scientist, which
      has made her deeply concerned about climate change. She has a Master’s
      degree in geography and is a former university manager with experience in
      strategic planning, resource allocation and risk management. She spent her
      honeymoon cycling in the Dordogne, and her dream flight-free trip would be
      to explore the Danube Delta by boat.

  - name: Steve Westlake
    bio: Steve works at Cardiff University and has a PhD in environmental psychology
      and behaviour change. His research explores the power of leading by
      example and how this influences the attitudes and behaviour of others. In
      Greenpeace as a teenager, he then worked for Shell and subsequently
      MotoGP, flying around the world to every race. Go figure! He believes
      those career choices were enabled by social and cultural norms that ignore
      environmental damage – hence his current research interests and belief in
      the mission of Flight Free UK.
