    <h1 class="text-4xl xl:text-5xl font-bold leading-tight mb-6">About us</h1>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl italic mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">"Our mission is to inform people of the climate impact of aviation and inspire people to travel by other means."</p>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">Flight Free UK was set up in 2018 by Anna Hughes, a behaviour change specialist and long-time advocate of flight-free travel. We challenge people to take a year off flying to reduce emissions and shift the norm away from aviation. Our short-term challenge is a great way to inspire long-term behaviour change, and we show that individual consumer choices can lead to industry and system change.</p>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">Prompted by the IPCC '12 year' report, and inspired by the <a href="https://westayontheground.org/about-us/" target="_blank" class="border-b-4 border-orange hover:text-orange">Swedish <i>flygfritt</i> (flight free) movement,</a> Flight Free UK launched its first 'flight free year' pledge in 2019. We collected over 6000 pledges from people promising to take a year off flying, before Covid came along and took the decision out of people's hands. You can read how Covid affected our campaign <a href="/articles" class="border-b-4 border-orange hover:text-orange">on our blog</a>. Despite the travel difficulties brought about by the pandemic, we have continued to inspire people to travel without flying for the sake of the climate.</p>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">We know that individual action alone isn't enough when it comes to responding to the climate emergency, but our campaign is about more than lots of individuals changing their travel behaviour. Our collective action puts pressure on government and industry to make low-carbon travel more accessible for more people. More powerfully, we are heavily influenced by those around us, so as more people choose to stay on the ground, many more will follow.</p>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">At Flight Free UK we focus on just one of the measures that will lead to a reduction in aviation, and we are part of a network of campaigns working in other areas, including resisting airport expansion, demanding fair taxation, and exposing government and industry greenwash.</p>
    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-8 leading-tight">Our positive campaign empowers and inspires people to give flight-free travel a try, for the sake of the climate and for their own benefit as travellers.</p>

    <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl italic leading-tight">"Flight Free UK feels like being part of a community that really does understand and really does care." ~ Sian, Bristol</p>
