    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">This policy sets out what information we ask for, what information we hold and for how long, and how we use your data. This applies to information collected through the Flight Free UK website (www.flightfree.co.uk). It shows how our practices comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations).</p>

    <p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">We ask all signatories of the flight free pledge to provide name, email address and location (country). This information is collected through the pledge tool on our website.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">By signing our pledge, your email address will be added to our mailing list. You can unsubscribe at any time. Unsuscribing will not affect your pledge, which will still be counted.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">We also ask if signatories are prepared to provide a testimonial, which is a photograph accompanied by a name. This is voluntary and initiated by the signatory.</p>
    <p><b>When do we contact you?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">We send one email per month to our mailing list. We might also contact you for technical reasons. At the end of the pledge year we will send one email to all pledgers, including those who have unsuscribed from the mailing list, to update them on the outcome of the campaign.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">We use this data to compile a list of supporters of our campaign. Your name is kept on our register and your email address is added to our Mailchimp mailing list. Your location is used to determine that you are eligible to sign our pledge (for UK residents only). Your name and email address is not published.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">Photographs supplied as part of a testimonial are uploaded to our social media platforms. These are then subject to the relevant social platforms’ Privacy Policies. By sending us your testimonial picture you give us persmission to use it as part of our campaigning.</p>
    <p><b>What legal basis do we have for processing your personal data?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">By signing our pledge, you give us your consent for us to process your personal data. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. By withdrawing your consent, your name is removed from our signatories’ list and will not be counted towards the pledge.</p>
    <p><b>When do we share personal data?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">We do not share your data with any third parties.</p>
    <p><b>Where do we store and process personal data?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">Your personal data will be treated confidentially. The Flight Free UK team and the We Stay on the Ground team can access the data, which is protected by password access. Your data is also held in the Mailchimp system, in accordance with Mailchimp’s Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><b>How long do we keep your personal data for?</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">Your data will be kept for five years. This is to keep signatories updated with the progress and impact of the campaign, and inform them of future campaigns that might be of interest. At the end of this time, your data will be securely deleted from our records. You can request that your data is securely removed before this date by contacting us.</p>
    <p><b>Your rights in relation to personal data</b></p>
    <p class="mb-6">Under the GDPR, you have the right to access and control your personal data. You can contact us at any time to find out what information we hold on you and how we use it. You may, at any time, ask us to correct or delete your data.</p>
