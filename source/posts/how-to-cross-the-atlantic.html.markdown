### Cargo ship

In previous years, the most common way for travellers to cross the ocean was by passage on a freighter. However, cargo ships stopped carrying passengers during Covid, and most haven’t started again. There is no indication of if or when the practice might start again, but here’s where you might find out:

In anticipation of this being an option in the future, here’s why travelling by cargo ship is great:

* emissions 40x lower than flying (e.g. flight to SA roughly 2 tonnes CO2 per passenger, cargo ship passage roughly 50g*)
* not adding demand to a polluting industry – the cargo ship goes whether you're on it or not, whereas that’s not the case with aviation, which exists as a result of passengers wanting to fly. (If you want to reduce the number of cargo ships in the world, buy less stuff! 90% of what we buy has come in some part via a cargo ship)
* unique and adventurous way to travel – there’s nothing like crossing an ocean and arriving in your destination by sea. As you travel further west, it gets warmer and warmer. Experience ocean wildlife as well as the strange world of shipping
* cabins are comfortable, meals with the crew each night, time and space to do your own thing. Crews often enjoy having passengers aboard as it breaks the monotony of life at sea. 

Aspects that take more resilience:

* you have to be incredibly flexible and wait for weeks then leave at the drop of a hat
* cost: €100 per night (passage is around 10 nights)
* there's no entertainment on board – you have to make your own!

We have some inspiring stories here  about people who have travelled by cargo ship: 

* Christine and Peter cycled from [Hadrian's Wall to the Great Wall of China](/post/wall-to-wall-without-flying/), then got a cargo ship back from Singapore. "Had we flown, our bodies would have arrived home before our brains."
* Lewis took a [cargo ship to South America](/podcast_transcripts/podcast-interview-lewis-mcneill/) to go travelling. "A highlight was seeing the stars at night, because when else are you going to be that far from human habitation?"
* Kate Rawles also journeyed to [South America by cargo ship](/podcast-series-episode-4-transatlantic-travel/), at the start of an 8,000 mile bike ride through the Andes from Colombia to Cape Horn.

### Sailing ship

By far the greenest and most adventurous option! Some companies offer this as a commercial passage, otherwise you can charter a boat or crew on one.

### Cruise liner

The Queen Mary II is the only commercial passenger ship to offer regular Atlantic crossings. It takes around seven days to cross the Atlantic on the Queen Mary II and costs around £1000. 

It's operated by the cruise company [Cunard](https://www.cunard.com/en-gb/cruise-destinations/transatlantic-cruises/what-is-a-transatlantic-cruise), and while it’s not the same as a cruise ship (it’s built for cross-ocean transit rather than bay cruising), it still has a sizeable carbon footprint. Our calculations show it’s around three times more carbon heavy than the equivalent flight.

QMII uses 1850 tonnes diesel (HFO) and 1000 tonnes gas (MGO) per transatlantic crossing (1). One tonne HFO produces 3.114 tonnes CO2, one tonne MGO produces 3.206 tonnes CO2 (2). 1850 tonnes HFO x 3.114 = 5,760.9 tonnes CO2. 1000 tonnes MGO x 3.206 = 3,206 tonnes CO2. Total tonnes CO2 (HFO + MGO) = 8,966.9 per transatlantic crossing. Divide by number of people on board (3,864)(3) = 2.32 tonnes each, or 4.64 tonnes for the return journey. Flying London to New York generates 1.415 tonnes per passenger for the return journey (4). Therefore QMII is just over 3 times the CO2 of the flight.

### R﻿epositioning cruises

A slightly cheaper way and less carbon intensive way is to be on a repositioning cruise – arguably the boat is going anyway so you're not responsible for the ship itself, just for what you use on board.
