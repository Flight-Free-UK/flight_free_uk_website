#### There are multiple locations around the UK mainland where you can take a ferry to Europe, Northern Ireland or one of our glorious archipelagos. Taking the ferry is a relaxing and adventurous way to travel, and if you take a bike or go by foot, the emissions savings are huge.

## Why travel by ferry?

Picture the scene: you wake in your cabin and open the blinds to see the sun rising over the Bay of Biscay. The land draws steadily nearer until you pull into the port in the same way as the explorers and travellers of old would once have done.

Arriving by sea is the most romantic and adventurous way to discover a new place. There’s plenty to do on board with cafes, restaurants, bars, duty-free, child-friendly areas, comfortable seating and plenty of space. Many ferry routes offer an overnight crossing, which means you can travel in comfort while you sleep.

## Car vs bike vs foot

Taking your car on the ferry can remove loads of the hassle from a family holiday, and if there are four of you in the car, your share of the emissions are much lower than flying. 

The most eco-friendly way to travel by ferry is either as a foot passenger or with a bike, arriving at the port by train. Many ferries cater well for bikes, with bike racks on the Harwich-Hook of Holland ferry (unsurprising for the Dutch destination).

It’s so easy to travel as a foot passenger, with swift check-in times and easy transfers to the port, although check before you travel: the P&O Liverpool-Dublin line, DFDS Dover to Calais and Dunkirk, or Brittany ferries Portsmouth to Le Havre do not carry foot passengers.

Best ports for travelling by foot are Newhaven, Fishguard, Harwich, and Holyhead, where the stations are adjacent to the pier. The ports on the other end have a similarly easy transfer to the station, apart from Dublin, where you might want to get a taxi. 

#### Walking times for others:

* L﻿iverpool (for Belfast) = 5 minute walk from Hamilton Square station (Birkenhead)
* Plymouth = 30 minute walk from Plymouth station 
* Poole = 25 minute walk from Poole station 
* Portsmouth = 25 minute walk from Portsmouth and Southsea station 
* Dover = 35 minute walk from Dover Priory station 
* Hull = 1 hour walk from Hull station 
* Newcastle = 20 minute walk from nearest Metro station 
* C﻿airnryan = the nearest station is Stranraer, 7 miles away, so from there you can get a bus or a taxi
