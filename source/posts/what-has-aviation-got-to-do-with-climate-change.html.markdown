  our emissions from flying is so important

### We know that burning fossil fuels is causing the planet to warm, and scientists are agreed that we need to reduce our CO2 emissions if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown.

There are lots of things that we as individuals can do to reduce emissions, including changing the way we eat, clothe ourselves and heat our homes. 

Taking a fight can often wipe out any savings made elsewhere. While aviation is said to be responsible for just 2% global emissions, that’s because globally, hardly anyone flies. When we look on an individual level, it’s much higher.

For example, a long haul flight to Indonesia generates more emissions per passenger than eating meat for a year or driving your car for a year (see bottom of page for a breakdown of the calculations).

More comparisons with flight emissions: 

* H﻿eating your home for a year = 2.7 tonnes CO2 = a return flight to LA (2.69 tonnes CO2)
* E﻿ating meat for a year = 2.06 tonnes CO2 = a return flight to Mumbai (2 tonnes CO2)
* D﻿riving a car for a year = 1.73 tonnes CO2 = a return flight to New York (1.75 tonnes CO2)

When we consider that the recommended sustainable footprint is just 2.3 tonnes per year, each, we quickly see that there simply isn’t any room for flights once we have included the things that are essential to living, such as food, shelter and warmth. 

If we are to move to a low-carbon society, cutting out non-essential sources of emissions will be vital, and for most people, that’s flights.

#### Non-CO2 emissions

Flying also generates NOx and water vapour in the form of contrails. Also radiative forcing means that emissions at altitude are likely to be two-three times higher than emissions at ground level. Greenhouse gas emissions stay in the atmosphere for a lot longer than the duration of your flight.

#### Global climate justice

The communities around the world that have done the least to cause the climate crisis are the ones suffering the most, and this injustice is even more stark when it comes to aviation. Just 5% of the global population flies in any given year, 1% of people produce 50% of aviation emissions, yet we all suffer the consequences of rising greenhouse gas emissions. 

#### What about travel?

Some people argue that the benefits of flying outweigh the harm, because travel gives us so much. That is true – travel does give us a lot of benefits – but it’s also true that travel and tourism can be extractive rather than beneficial to the places we go to. 

Not flying doesn’t mean not travelling, and there are plenty of places we can still access without getting on a plane, and have a much more enriching experience doing it. See our [Destination Inspiration](/how_to/#destination-inspiration) pages for ideas.
