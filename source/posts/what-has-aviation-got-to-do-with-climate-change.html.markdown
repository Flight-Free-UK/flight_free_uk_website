We know that burning fossil fuels is causing the planet to warm, and scientists are agreed that we need to reduce our CO2 emissions if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown.

There are lots of things that we as individuals can do to reduce emissions, including changing the way we eat, clothe ourselves and heat our homes. 

Taking a fight can often wipe out any savings made elsewhere. While aviation is said to be responsible for just 2% global emissions, that’s because globally, hardly anyone flies. When we look on an individual level, it’s much higher. 

For example, a long haul flight to Indonesia generates more emissions per passenger than eating meat for a year or driving your car for a year.

When we consider that the recommended sustainable footprint is just 2.3 tonnes per year, each, we quickly see that there simply isn’t any room for flights once we have included the things that are essential to living, such as food, shelter and warmth. 

If we are to move to a low-carbon society, cutting out non-essential sources of emissions will be vital, and for most people, that’s flights.
