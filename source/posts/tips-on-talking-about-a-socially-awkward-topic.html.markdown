## **T﻿ell your story**

Talk about why not flying, or flying less, is important to you. Tell a story about a flight-free holiday you have had. Making it personal usually helps others to not feel attacked. 

## **Ask questions rather than challenge**

Someone has just mentioned their forthcoming trip by air. The expected reaction is usually to ooh and aah about the holiday even though you might want to say, ‘flying is really bad for the environment’. How about asking, ‘Have you considered travelling to x location (i.e. closer to home)?’ or ‘Did you know you can get there by train?’ If you ask in a non-challenging way, it should open up a conversation rather than shut it down. 

## **Keep it positive**

Try to avoid negative or guilt-inducing language. Talk about how taking action on issues such as this can make a positive impact: we can make a difference with our actions; we will leave a better world for our children if we take action now; not flying doesn't mean not travelling; this isn't about giving something up, it's about doing things differently for the benefit of future generations.

## **Have a few facts up your sleeve**

Some general facts, such as one long-haul flight being the equivalent of driving for a year, could add punch to your conversation. If we are to follow IPCC guidelines, our individual carbon output needs to be reduced to between 2 and 3 tonnes per year. Flying to Gran Canaria emits 1 tonne of CO2 – half your annual allowance! 

## **Have courage!**

Don’t assume that people don’t care about this. Assume that everyone would be prepared to fight for the climate if they knew what was at stake. By having an easy-going conversation, it’s possible to discuss those issues in a non-judgmental way. People might be more receptive than you think.
