### I pledge to go flight free in 2021 because as a geographer and environmentalist I am very aware of the impact of aviation emissions on our planet and the industry’s contribution to the climate crisis.

I also want to challenge myself. I first signed up to Flight Free 2020 to force me to look at other ways of travelling or look at exploring my local area or different cities within the United Kingdom where I’ve never been.

> “I first signed up to force me to look at other ways of travelling.”

It’s a difficult one for sure because I have family who live abroad and as a geographer, I have a strong desire to travel. But I guess the flight free pledge makes me more conscious of how aviation emissions can impact countries in the global south and how by travelling frequently to these areas we are putting them at greater risk.

### By signing this pledge I’m committing to be a conscious traveller. I’m committing to acknowledging all the different ways that we pollute our planet and to advocate for flight free and local travel.

#### *Thank you, Francisca! Could you [join](/take_action/) Francisca and commit to a flight free year?*
