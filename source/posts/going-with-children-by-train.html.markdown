If you are a parent you might baulk at the thought of taking young children on long train journeys, but it could be easier than you think. No travel comes without its challenges, but train travel often has advantages over flying.

Many parents find that train travel suits their children better once they give it a try, so we have collected some tips from experienced mums and dads for the best ways to travel by train with kids. 

## **1. Take advantage of free travel for kids**

The majority of trains in Europe have free travel for children up to four years old, as opposed to up to two years old on a plane. 

On the [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.de/en/view/index.shtml) in Germany, children under the age of six can travel for free without a ticket. Even up to the age of 14, kids are free on the DB if accompanied by a parent or grandparent, if their names are added to the adult’s ticket. 

On the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/), kids under the age of four must sit on a parent’s lap unless there is a spare seat available, but children of all ages can have their own seat in Germany. This means that rail travel can work out cheaper overall.

Interrail is also an option. Children go free on an Interrail pass up to the age of 12, so this can work out much cheaper for families than buying tickets direct, and can give more flexibility.

## **2. Carry as much luggage as you need** 

Travelling as a family often requires plenty of luggage, and one of the great advantages to travelling by train is that there are no extra costs for taking as much as you need with you. There aren’t the same limits on baby milk or food which makes the journey so much easier. 

## **3. Book a table seat**

Trains generally have more space and are much more comfortable than planes. You can easily move around if you need to, in case of tantrums or noisy episodes, and vestibule areas are great for giving your fellow passengers a break.

Table seats are fantastic to be able to play board games as a family. They can facilitate puzzles, crosswords or colouring, and plug sockets at tables mean that tablets or devices can be plugged in for movies or games.

There's also the opportunity to walk about and go and visit the cafe/bar to choose some drinks and snacks.

## **4. Time passes differently on the train**

A 12-hour train journey might sound like a nightmare, but it's not the same as a 12-hour flight. Regular stops provide structure and interest, and it's likely you will need to make connections in that time, which breaks things up in a positive way. Allowing extra time for connections means that interchanges can be adventures in their own right.

B﻿reaking the journey overnight can be a good way to give everyone a break as well as spend time in a new city.

## **5. Add stops for lunch or overnight**

A﻿s with any overland travel, the journey is part of the holiday. You can make this more intentional by incorporating overnight stops, often for no extra cost in your ticket. It's a good idea to break the journey for lunch and a walk around the area surrounding the station – dropping bags at Left Luggage can help with this.

## **6. Start short and work up the distance** 

S﻿tarting with a short hop to a nearby European city can ease you into travelling with your child, and from there you can build up the distances. 

## 7﻿. Try sleeper trains

We have been to France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and last year we took the [Caledonian Sleeper](https://www.sleeper.scot)Sleeper trains are always a real hit with children. It's exciting to be in bed on a train, and the clever compartments, foldable beside tables and hidden sinks are a novelty. The most exciting thing is going to sleep in a busy city and waking up surrounded by Scottish mountains or cruising along the Cornish Riviera. This is true for adults as well as children! 

T﻿ravelling while asleep can save time and money (compared to a hotel) and has the added excitement factor. Just remember to pack ear plugs and eye mask to ensure a sound night's sleep.

## 8﻿. Book early for the best price

### **Tips for planning your journey**

The [Man in Seat Sixty-One](www.seat61.com) website is invaluable, and the [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.de/en/view/index.shtml) website and [Rail Europe](https://raileurope.co.uk) (formerly loco2) are also really useful. To get the best prices, it's best to book early – you can set up ticket alerts on Rail Europe which will let you know in advance when tickets go on sale. I try and make sure we have a table seat, and some train companies have special family areas on their trains, so we look out for those seats where they have them.

We have found Deutsche Bahn to be the most child friendly so far on our travels. Not only can children travel for free with their own seat, they get free toys and magazines from the cafe.

### **Must haves:**

~ Take plenty of food and drinks, although prioritise meals and water, as it’s easy to buy a hot drink (even in your own cup!) or snacks, but it can be difficult to get your water bottle refilled. 

~ Take plenty of activities to entertain the kids, including card games or colouring books. It's also a good idea to download some games or videos for your electronic devices: while plugs are available for recharging, the WiFi/phone signal can be intermittent. 

~ Take a wheelie suitcase and rucksack each, so you can manage your luggage walking between trains. Our son managed his own rucksack and suitcase from the age of four.

#### I don't miss flying and am always excited to plan our next rail adventure as a family. When talking to other parents about our holidays, it surprises me how many people don’t even consider the train as an option. I hope that by sharing our experiences, a few more families will give it a go.
