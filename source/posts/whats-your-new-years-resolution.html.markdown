### What’s your New Year’s resolution? 

It seems every year we resolve to live better, to lose weight or to do more exercise, or to finally learn that guitar we bought years ago. January is the busiest month for gym memberships – and the busiest for cancellations.

Apparently, most resolutions are abandoned by January 18th. Does the buzz of enthusiasm wane after a couple of weeks? Does harsh reality set in? Do the cold, dark days make that daily run seem increasingly unappealing?

Perhaps we're more likely to stick with a resolution if we can see that it benefits other people as well as us. How about taking that to the next level, and doing something that’s good for you, good for each other, *and* good for the planet?

Taking a year off flying is a great way to reduce emissions, and to inspire a social shift away from aviation. There are huge benefits, from the people who live near flight paths who will have quieter skies, to the people around the world who are living with the effects of climate change. 

It also benefits you as a traveller. Flight free travel is a much more exciting, enriching and less stressful way to see the world.

The best thing about joining a pledge like this is that you're not doing it alone. It really helps to keep your resolution when you can see that many other people are doing it with you. 

#### Thousands of people have already signed the pledge to be flight free in 2022. Could you join them?
