What’s your New Year’s resolution? 

It seems every year we make resolutions to live better, to 

This month is the busiest for gym memberships.

Is it to eat more healthily? To exercise more? To drink less?

Maybe it’s to try a new skill? Or to read more books? Or learn another language? 

How about doing something that’s as good for the planet as it is for you?

Apparently, most resolutions are abandoned by January 18th. We've got plenty to help you stick with your pledge. And of course, you know you're not alone – thousands of people are staying grounded for the climate. 

Our pledge asks people to take a year off flying. It’s a great way to reduce emissions, and to change the norm when it comes to aviation. Of course, the last couple of years have been pretty flight free for most people. But when you choose to do this for the climate, it can be an exciting and empowering change.



Let’s hear from some of the people who have taken our pledge.



Miriam says, Initially I thought I could never do without flying – I thought it was a crazy pledge. But now I’ve taken it, I feel much less stressed, I feel a lot more relaxed and I really appreciate my local surroundings. I’m also looking forward to doing a slow holiday across the continent.



Liffy and Jonathan say, we’ve just travelled from Glasgow to Granada in Spain to see our daughter. It took three days but when you travel like this, the simple things become the adventure. We wouldn’t have missed that experience for anything.



Sunita says, it feels wrong to take a flight knowing that the carbon emissions will affect families all over the world. The flight free pledge is a symbolic statement to demand a better, more just world for all.



Thousands of people have already signed the pledge to be flight free in 2022. Could you join them? Make the pledge at flightfree.co.uk
