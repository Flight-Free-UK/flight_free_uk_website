### For many people, travelling to city break destinations will involve a flight. But it doesn’t have to be that way. We explore how to reach your favourite city break destination without flying. 

We are so lucky that the huge variety offered by continental Europe is right on our doorstep. Travelling overland might seem longer, but once you’ve factored in transfers, baggage claim and check-in time, air travel doesn’t work out as quick as you think. In any case, the beauty of overland travel is that the journey is part of the destination. So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride!

## Utrecht, Netherlands

Unsurprisingly for the fourth biggest city in the Netherlands, Utrecht is packed full of bicycles and waterways. The city has all the charm of the Dutch – from the [Miffy Museum](https://nijntjemuseum.nl/?lang=en) to the Hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles) on sale in every supermarket – but with much more tranquility than the capital, Amsterdam. 

For perfect peace and quiet, walk along the low-level canals or [hire a paddle boat](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/utrecht/canals-of-utrecht.htm) and admire the characteristic wharf cellars housing waterside cafes. Stop off at a ‘pannenkoeken’ restaurant for a Dutch crepe; we recommend [De Oude Muntkelder](http://www.deoudemuntkelder.nl/) which has over 80 varieties (try the Dutch pancake with hot cherries, vanilla ice-cream, cherry liqueur and whipped cream), in addition to gluten free and vegan batters. 

From anywhere in the city, travellers can see the oldest and highest church tower in Holland, [Dom Tower](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/utrecht/dom-tower.htm). Another highlight is the [Oude Hortus](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/utrecht/the-oude-hortus.htm), a natural oasis in the city centre which was the former botanical garden of Utrecht university.

#### Getting there

Despite how easy and cheap it is to get to the Netherlands without flying, London to Amsterdam is the second busiest flight route in Europe! There are plenty of options for getting to Utrecht:

**By train:** Take the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/train/netherlands/london-to-amsterdam) direct from London to Rotterdam/Amsterdam, then change to a local train to Utrecht. Dutch trains are frequent, cheap and efficient.

**By ferry:** Three ferry routes operate between the UK and the Netherlands: [Stena Line](https://www.stenaline.co.uk/rail) from Harwich to Hoek van Holland, [P&O ](http://www.poferries.com/en/hull-rotterdam)from Hull to Rotterdam [](http://www.poferries.com/en/hull-rotterdam)or [DFDS](https://www.dfds.com/en-gb/passenger-ferries/ferry-crossings/ferries-to-holland/newcastle-amsterdam) from Newcastle to Amsterdam.

**By coach:** Coaches travel [overnight from London Victoria](https://www.omio.co.uk/coaches/london/utrecht) to Utrecht Centraal Station.

## Berlin, Germany

The German capital has been attracting UK city-breakers for years because of its urban cool and rich history. It could also be that the city has no official closing time with events happening around the clock, throughout the year: live concerts, jazz clubs, cocktail bars and casinos.

Top attractions include [Museum Island](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/museum-island-in-berlin#/) (don’t miss the bust of Nefertiti in the Neues Museum), the cathedral [Berliner Dom](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-cathedral) and the Brandenburg Gate. 

Everywhere you look in Berlin, you can feel the true weight of this city’s tumultuous past. To see what remains of the Berlin wall, visit the [Bornholmer Straße](https://www.berlin.de/mauer/en/sites/former-checkpoints/bornholmer-strasse/) border crossing (the first border to open on 9 November 1989), [Checkpoint Charlie](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/checkpoint-charlie) or the 1.3 km East Side Gallery, painted by 118 artists from 21 countries. 

[Mauerpark](https://www.berlin.de/en/shopping/markets-and-flea-markets/1998222-2983302-flea-market-at-mauerpark.en.html) also contains a remnant of the wall; amble around the flea market in the park on Sundays for old records, instruments and bicycles, and if you’re brave enough, perform your favourite karaoke song in front of a couple hundred people in the amphitheatre! 

#### Getting there

**By train:** Take the Eurostar to Brussels, then take high-speed trains to Cologne and onwards to Berlin.
