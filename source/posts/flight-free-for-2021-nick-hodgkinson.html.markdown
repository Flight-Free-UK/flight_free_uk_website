## I’ve taken the pledge to go totally flight free in 2021. That’s because flying is the single most climate damaging thing that I could do.

### We all depend on the same climate so we all need to protect it. My nephew lives in Berlin and he’s got three beautiful kids. I want them to live in a safer and greener world when they grow up.

I’m involved in the campaign to stop Leeds Bradford Airport from expanding (www.galba.uk). If our local Council approves the airport’s planning application, it will double its greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years. Yet scientists tell us that we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions as far and as fast as possible in the next 10 years. Airport expansion would be *plane* crazy!

We’ve heard a lot of talk about ‘jet zero’ and zero carbon flying. It would be great if that could be a commercial reality sometime soon. But the real experts, the Committee on Climate Change, say it won’t. They warn that the new technologies needed to make commercial airliners zero carbon won’t be feasible before 2050. That’s too late. 

> “We’ve had to adapt our lives to deal with Covid. If we start adapting our lives to deal with the climate crisis now, we can help make a better future.”

We’ve all had to adapt our lives to deal with the Covid crisis. It’s tough but we’ve also learned things – lockdown has made us look at new ways of living. For example, who used Zoom as much as we do now? The good news is that if we start adapting our lives to deal with the climate crisis – right now – we can help to make a better future for people all around the world. And if I want to see my family in Berlin, I’ll use a more sustainable form of transport, like the train. As a wheelchair user, the train is much easier for me than trying to fit into a cramped plane.
