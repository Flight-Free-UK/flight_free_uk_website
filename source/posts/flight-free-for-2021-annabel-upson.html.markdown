### I have been fortunate to explore the hidden corners of the world, connecting with incredible people, and learning about cultures, histories and environments.

##### But I realised along the way that how I was travelling was impacting the world.

I dreamt up a plan with a friend on how we could make better choices so that we could protect the world as we explored it. We wanted to help others do the same so we created a new kind of travel company that embodies the message that travelling more sustainably is possible. Our company, [Travelling Whale](https://www.travellingwhale.com/) is committed to creating positive change in the travel industry in the collective quest to use travel as a force for good. 

Signing the flight free pledge in January 2021 was another step to prove to myself and others that small ripples make big waves. The journey for me to a destination has always brought out the most incredible stories and memories. Itâ€™s a chance to sit back, take a breath and enjoy the scenery. 

##### Air travel in Europe is roughly 90% more polluting than if you travel by train. 

Going flight free was a no-brainer for me, especially as you can often get to a destination in a similar time when you factor all the time wasted at an airport. 

I hope to help travellers become flight free by encouraging slow travel and showing them alternate ways to reach their destination.
