## We can’t deny that the year got off to a pretty bad start with your flight to Australia in the government jet.

### Perhaps you were advised badly; maybe you didn’t realise that burning [150 tonnes of fuel would add 500 tonnes of CO2](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-australia-flew-private-jet-taxpayers-cost-1426754) to an atmosphere that’s already bulging with greenhouse gases. 

Possibly you were sold on the need for “security” – a very noble aim, because of course who would not want to protect people and make sure they were safe? You just forgot to think about the security of the global community, and the generations that come next. 

Don’t worry, there’s still time to rectify things, even though as recently as last month you were still flying around – [this time in a private helicopter](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-charters-luxury-private-helicopter-to-campaign-tory-leadership-election-1777005). Perhaps no one told you about the fast, low-carbon way to get from London to Leeds. They might have hoodwinked you by saying that it would be quicker to visit your supporters this way, or that is was worth the emissions, even though of course you know that demonstrating climate leadership is much more powerful.

> "Demonstrating climate leadership is much more powerful."

In fact, you’re probably just on the verge of taking [your own advice, written in 2007](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/reactions-as-quote-about-travel-comes-back-to-haunt-truss-309835/): *“Public servants should spend taxpayer’s money with the care they would give to their own. This would be reflected in changes such as travelling by economy rather than business class.”* 

Can we add ‘rather than private jet’? Could we also add ‘by train rather than by air’? We'll even go as far as to add an update for 2022: 

*“Public servants should treat our collective home (the earth) with as much care as they would give to their own.”* 

This means no more private flights to UK cities that are easily reached by train, and certainly no jaunts to the other side of the world by private jet. The cost to us is not just through our taxes (£500,000 for the Australia flight – you probably weren’t told about that part), but through our future. 

> "No more private flights to UK cities, and no jaunts to the other side of the world by private jet."

A lot has changed in the 12 months since you said, “flights make life worth living.” We’re certain you wouldn’t say such an insensitive thing now, when it’s clear that our high-carbon, jet-set lifestyles are directly contributing to fatal extreme weather events around the world: the [Madagascar famine in November 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/06/madagascar-paying-price-for-cheap-european-flights-says-climate-minister), the devastating [floods in Pakistan in August 2022](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62728678), the [hottest days ever recorded in the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/19/uk-weather-record-hottest-day-ever-heatwave) this summer. Because as you certainly know, it’s food, shelter, water and security that makes life worth living. And a stable future for our children. Not flights. 

> "It’s food, shelter, water and security that makes life worth living, not flights." 

We understand that it’s difficult as a politician to tell the truth. It’s much easier to pretend the climate crisis is not happening, and reassure people that we can maintain our high-carbon activities whilst also reducing emissions. 

It’s much easier to keep on saying things like, "[the way to reduce emissions from flying is not to stop flying](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10152015/COP26-Liz-Truss-says-Brits-flying.html).” Your adviser on this one must have been really having you on. Because actually, the only way to reduce emissions from flying *is* to stop flying! It is the most immediate, most simple, and best solution to the problem. There might be room for technology in the future, but we need to be realistic about cutting emissions *now*.

> "Stopping flying is the most immediate, most simple, and best solution to the problem." 

The best joke of all is that you said you’ll likely scrap the green levy once you’ve settled in at Number 10! Imagine, the leader of a country not prioritising climate policies at this stage in the climate crisis. Yes, definitely a joke. 

Now you’re in charge, you can drop the pretence and show the country that you were having us on all along. Stop all airport expansion – more planes means more emissions. Tax aviation fuel – just think how much you could raise to fund your green aviation then! Increase APD on domestic flights and invest in rail – then there’ll be no excuse for flying from London to Leeds. Scrap frequent flyer rewards programmes and instead tax people the more they fly. Incentivise low carbon travel, not flights.

### Remember that you are now the leader of one of the most influential nations in the world. Use your influence wisely, Liz, otherwise the joke will be on all of us, and not just on you.
