*Intro: February half term is a great time for skiing – and it's also a great time to be ill, so please forgive my voice! If you’re one of those people heading off for a ski trip, you might be thinking about which flight to take, but have you considered taking the train? Daniel Elkan has been hitting the slopes by train for over a decade, and he set up the website SnowCarbon to help other people do the same.*



DAN



When I first started skiing I didn't have a clue about how to get the Alps. I was going with some friends, they said, turn up at Gatwick at 5am, so I did, and there were thousands of people looking grumpy, shuffling through queues, and I thought it would be a quick journey because it’s only a 90 minute flight, and the whole journey must have taken about 10 hours. This is ridiculous! How can something take that long? You’re only going to Europe.



DAN 1



so the next time I went skiing I thought, it can’t take that long this time. But it did.

When we were approaching the resort on the coach from the airport I looked down the valley and saw this glinting piece of metal that I realised was a railway track and I thought, maybe it would have been possible to get here by train, but no one in the resort seemed to know how long it would take.



When I got home I went into my loft and found an old European rail timetable from an Interrail trip and saw that it was only one Eurostar and a TGV to get to this resort in Italy, and it looked as though it would take about the same amount of time as we spent flying.



ANNA 2



*In our modern society, the default is to fly, so it doesn’t even cross our minds that we can travel by other means. Everything is skewed towards that flight when we book holidays, from adverts to the booking systems to the information given to you by your package provider. This all contributes to the social norm to fly, which is what we’re challenging with our Flight Free 2020 campaign.*



ANNA 3



*The Interrail map had shown Daniel that train was an option, and had inspired him to start organising ski trips by train for him and his mates. But finding out the how to book the journey was the difficult part. Nothing was joined up. That’s what led to him setting up the website SnowCarbon, a guide to how to travel to the ski resorts by train:[www.snowcarbon.co.uk](http://www.snowcarbon.co.uk)*



DAN 2



I set up the website 10 years ago, but I'd been writing about how to get to the ski slopes by train for about five years before that as a freelance journalist, writing articles for newspapers and magazines, but I realised it was still difficult to find out the different elements of the journey, so I realised that if you put all this information in one place, make an online guide that's really useful but also really inspiring, showing people what the journeys are like, where you can go, create a place where other skiers can share their experiences, so on Snowcarbon we have a section called Your Stories where people write into the site and talk about what they thought of the journey. You always get really useful tips and insights from other people so it’s very much a community feel. By skiers for skiers.



ANNA 4



*A quick glance at the website reveals there's a whopping carbon saving with each train journey – about 90%. But Daniel quickly found out that wasn't the only benefit. As well as the carbon reduction, travelling overland is just a much better experience than flying.*



DAN 1



The initial motivation was environmental, but once we started doing the journeys I realised how much fun it is just to be with your mates on the train – it really becomes part of the holiday. And often you’d be in the resort and people talk about what the journey was like, and people would say, how did you get here and we’d say we came by train, and they would say yes but where did you fly to, and we’d say, no, we came all the way by train, moment of realisation, they’d say how long did it take, and then a husband and wife would nudge each other and say, darling, we need to do that next year. Yes!!



ANNA 5



*Picture the scene: you're on the train, with your mates, and you’ve got this huge chunk of time together, relaxing rather than standing in a queue, there’s loads of space, especially if you get a table seat, you can play games, have a chat, read, visit the cafe bar, bring bubbles, and all the time this incredible landscape is scrolling past the window.*



DAN 1



Meet people, talk to people, there's a good vibe. When you see kids on board they're not screaming, they're having a good time, they're engaged in stuff, it's almost like the train’s rocking them into this state of calmness. Every year I go with a big group and not everyone knows each other, but by the time we get to the chalet, everyone’s bonded and everyone’s had a great time.



When you travel by plane it’s just one long conveyor belt of stop starts, boring, queuing, baggage, cramped flight, cramped transfer. There’s no time for you to do anything, certainly not to feel like part of the holiday.



ANNA 6



*Now, back to the environmental impact. The SnowCarbon website talks about taking better care of our planet and minimising our use of fossil fuels and resources. Even though there are many sustainable ways of travelling to the Alps, most skiers fly or drive. So what \*are\* the environmental benefits of going by train? And should we even be skiing at all?*



DAN 2



So for a journey to the Alps, carbon emissions by plane are about 110kg CO2 and by train it’s about 12 or 13kg. So 90% is the average amount by which you can reduce your carbon emissions. About 57 - 63% of the emissions of the entire ski resort are created by the journey there. So the one thing you can do that transforms your carbon footprint, it's to go by train.



Everything you do creates carbon. Skiing is an amazing activity, to get out into nature and be active. and for the pleasure that it gives, it isn’t particularly carbon intensive vs other kinds of holidays.



ANNA 7



*So changing that flight for a train has a huge impact, and there are loads of options for travelling by train. There’s the direct ski train from London all the way to the tarentais region of the French Alps. For other parts of France, and for Austria, Italy or Switzerland, you can travel via Paris, Lille, or Brussels and changing from the Eurostar to the TGV, which is the French high speed train. Or you can catch the Alpen Express sleeper train to Austria, or the NightJet sleeper from Cologne. But, there's a real challenge here. Many people would say, I would love to travel by train – it sounds fantastic! But I just can’t afford it. The flight is £29 – that's just irresistible.*



DAN 3



There's often an assumption that train travel’s a lot more expensive. The truth is, it’s not. In many cases, particularly at peak dates for family, going by train is going to save you money, but people don't think that so they just assume that the flights are cheaper.

When you travel by train, there are no charges for luggage, no charges for skis, you can take whatever you want on board, transfer from train station much shorter

When you travel by plane, you see that £29 one way fare and it's very enticing, but you go through the system and you add your luggage, and your skis, and the transfer. So often people think they're getting a cheap flight, and they come out the other end and the price is not cheap.



ANNA 8



*So, overall it’s either cheaper or close enough, and you’re going to have a much better experience – Daniel’s really keen to ask us, what is our time worth? However you get there, it’s going to take all day, so shouldn’t you spend your money on something that’s going to be enjoyable and do a favour to the planet?*

*But even once we’ve made that decision there are still plenty of barriers in the way. Cost-wise, time-wise it’s about the same, and eco-wise it's way better, but it's still pretty impossible to book!*



DAN 3



Very often, there’s just an assumption in the ski industry that people are going to fly. So you read articles, websites, tour operators who only mention where the nearest airport is – no mention of the train. People are being primed all the time to fly, and that has to change.



It’s vital that ski resorts/accommodations/tour operators communicate for every destination at least where the train station is, links from the train station to the resort. What is also crucial is that the train companies make it much easier for tour operators to include rail as part of the package. At the moment, the policies of train companies is pretty unfriendly towards the trade, and there are loads of tour operators that would love to be including train travel – it makes lots of sense for them, not just environmentally but in terms of enabling passengers to have a lovely journey.



ANNA 9



*So how about us as consumers? Can we drive this change, this demand for lower-carbon modes of transport? It seems recently the conversation is really starting to shift away from air travel, and awareness of the carbon impact from aviation has really gone up. What needs to happen now in order to make the most of this?*



DAN 4



Over the past year I’ve seen a real transformation in the reasons that people give for wanting to go by train. The train has always made sense, from a practical point of view, from an experience point of view, but now people are talking about how they don’t want to fly anymore and the environment is a big motivation. That gives great hope, but the supply of available trains & tickets can’t meet the number of skiers that would want to go by train, unless the industry sorts itself out.



DAN 4



Demand by consumers is an absolutely vital part of the picture, but we haven’t got time to wait for consumer pressure to make the changes people need. There’s got to be action from government, there's got to be action from industry, there’s got to be players being very active in saying the system’s broken, the system needs to change, we know that lots of people want to travel this way and lots more would given the option. We can’t wait for market pressure to change things – that’s not quick enough, given the environmental challenges we face.



ANNA 10



*One of our favourite parts of the SnowCarbon website is the video of the race to the Alps, a Top Gear style experiment to see if what Daniel says about travelling by train is really true. It’s a great watch, so here's Daniel explaining what it's all about.*





DAN 4



Video!



I’ve been in so many conversations with skiers who can’t imagine that you can get to the slopes as quickly by train as you can by plane, so I thought, what’s the best way of showing this, so I challenged a fellow ski journalist, Neil English, to a race. We decided the destination would be a hot tub in a chalet in Méribel and we both set out from London at the same time



DAN 5



I was going by Eurostar to Paris then a TGV to the Alps, he was flying from Gatwick to Geneva, and we modelled it on Top Gear, having conversations in real time, he absolutely thought he was going to smash it. In the end there was 35 minutes between us, and a very, very different journey. It really showed the frustration – he played a brilliant Jeremy Clarkson – and all his frustration at the amount of time different things take while I was chilling with a bottle of wine and a good book on the train.



ANNA 11 + 11a + 11b



*And there we have it! A thorough examination of a ski journey by train, which vs plane, comes out on top pretty much every time. It’s been brilliant hearing Daniel’s expertise and we hope it’s inspired you to get booking that train next time you head off on your ski holiday!*

*You can find out more at[www.snowcarbon.co.uk](http://www.snowcarbon.co.uk), which has all those things Daniel talked about, including a ticketing tool to help you book, and stories from fellow skiers. Top tips are to start your planning early, so you really know what you’re doing, and you can take advantage of the best fares. You can also find relevant information on the website[seat61.com](http://seat61.com), and there’s also the website Ski Flight Free.*

*Daniel’s personal recommendation is to get a rail map of Europe and put it up on the wall. They’re beautiful and inspiring, and make a great present. Thanks again to Daniel, and thanks for listening!*
