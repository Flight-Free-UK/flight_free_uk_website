## Transport

### Take the coach

Travelling by coach is probably the cheapest way to travel, and can even rival budget airlines. There are several coach companies that provide long-distance travel through Europe, and we recommend [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/). Their coaches are modern and comfortable, with charging points and wifi so there's plenty to keep you occupied. The network covers an extensive number of European destinations from Sweden to Spain and everywhere in between.

Overnight coach travel can be a great way to cover some miles while you sleep, although comfort varies. Top recommendation: eye mask, ear plugs and neck pillow!

Carbon emissions of coach travel are around 40% of air travel, so you’re making a great saving on emissions as well as cash.

### Go by ferry

Taking the ferry to the continent is often much cheaper than going by train. There are lots of options from the south and east coast of England, all the way from Plymouth to Newcastle. Our ‘How to travel by ferry’ page will tell you everything you need to know.

### Try Rail and Sail

Speaking of ferries, the ‘[Rail and Sail](https://www.stenaline.co.uk/rail-and-sail)’ ticket offer from Stena line means that getting to the Netherlands or Ireland by a combination of train and boat can often work out cheaper than flying. The ticket covers any UK rail station, so you can travel from your home to Dublin via Holyhead, to Belfast via Stranraer, or any Dutch station via Harwich for a fixed price.

### Interrail

No longer the preserve of backpacking students, [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en) has seen a resurgence in recent years. Buying a pass can work out to be very cost-effective if your journey has several legs. Look out for sales on Interrail passes throughout the year. 

### Book early

As with any travel, the earlier you book, the cheaper it is. You can set alerts on [RailEurope](https://www.raileurope.com/) to let you know when tickets go on sale.

## Accommodation

### Hostelling

Hostels are a great option for budget travel, and you’ll find them in towns and cities across the UK and Europe. Accommodation is basic, usually in a dorm with other people, with shared bathrooms and self-service kitchen facilities. 

### Camping

Bringing your own accommodation in the form of a tent can really keep the costs down, and you’ll find campsites in most locations across Europe. The facilities can be very satisfactory: all campsites will have washrooms, and some will also have restaurants and bars. 

It's possible to camp without using a campsite: networks such as Stay in my garden and PitchUp can be a fantastic way of staying in a new location for free, at the same time as meeting people and making connections with the locals. 

Wild camping (pitching up away from an ‘official’ campsite) can be a terrific option and gives ultimate freedom in terms of where you go, but be careful that you’re not trespassing on private land. Rules for wild camping: keep away from roads or houses, and don’t leave any rubbish or anything behind.

### Couchsurfing

There are several networks throughout the UK and Europe that offer free accommodation in people’s houses. Couchsurfing is the oldest and most established, and there’s also Warmshowers (specifically for touring cyclists). 

### Stay with a friend/houseswap

Staying with friends or even houseswapping is a great way to see somewhere new while getting some free accommodation. Look up Houseswap online. 

## Food

### Markets

Keep your eating costs down by seeking out local markets wherever you’re travelling. Not only is it an excellent way to save a few pennies, it has the advantage of immersing you in the local culture and cuisine. Markets have a great vibe and can provide all your food needs at a very low price.
