## Ever since we launched our campaign in early 2019 we've been asking people if they could take a flight free year. 

The idea gained national media attention and we started #FlightFree2020 with over 6000 people on our pledge, ready to celebrate a year of flight free travel and climate action. No one could have predicted what would happen next. 

### 2020 was indeed the year we all stayed grounded. But not through choice. 

The coronavirus pandemic put a huge strain on all of our lives. It affected everything, and our campaign was no exception. Our events, publicity and news coverage quietly slipped away.

But there were positives. Clear skies were seen across the world, in many cases for the first time. There was a record drop in air pollution and emissions. The few months of absolute lockdown gave us a sense of ‘restart’, a glimpse of what we need to do in order to avert the climate crisis.

### Even with the 90% drop in airline bookings that we saw last year, we are still asking people to take the flight free pledge.

While Covid has naturally dominated the headlines, the climate crisis hasn’t gone away. Aviation remains the [fastest way](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/big-ticket-action-for-the-climate/) to raise your footprint above sustainable levels. We continue to burn fossil fuels even though there is already more CO2 in the atmosphere than the world can handle. Flying continues to be the default mode of travel for many of us, with airline tickets bought without a thought given to the alternatives. Talk of offsetting and ‘sustainable aviation’ makes us believe that we can continue to live our lives as normal.

The purpose of the Flight Free Year is first and foremost about reducing emissions by encouraging people to take a year off flying. But just as important is the social effect of that decision. We humans are easily influenced by those around us – we usually want to fit in with the crowd. The advantage of this is that change can happen quickly. If lots of people take a flight free year, many more will follow.

Having our freedom of choice taken away never leads to long-term change. As soon as the pandemic is over, many people will return to the skies – an understandable desire to get out of here after the year we’ve just had. 

What we need is for people to make this a choice: a positive, empowering decision that is not only good for the planet, it’s good for us. Travelling overland rather than by air is an [enriching experience](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/the-beauty-of-slow-travel/) and the purpose of the year-off challenge is to prompt people to try these other options and discover the joy of travelling differently for themselves and the planet. 

Of course, we don’t have to travel at all. What many people [discovered during the lockdown](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/light-in-the-lockdown/) is the beauty in our own back yards that we often overlook. For many, it's been the inability to see our loved ones that has been the difficult part, not sitting on a plane. As one of our pledgers said, “I'd be happy never leaving the country again if only I could see my friends.”

Many people will be wishing a not-so-fond farewell to 2020 and looking to brighter things in 2021. Seeing loved ones, travelling, enjoying the freedoms that have been denied to us. But those things aren't dependent on getting on a plane. 

Choices rather than requirements are more likely to lead to the long-term behaviour change that we so desperately need.
