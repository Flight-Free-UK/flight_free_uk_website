## Back in the spring of 2019 I had a penny drop moment. Lots of learning had culminated with listening to Gem Bendell’s ‘Deep Adaption: A Map For Navigating Climate Tragedy’.

### Knowing we are facing climate catastrophe that is devastating lives (most dramatically those contributing least to the problem), is very different from believing and acting upon that belief.

I switched from knowing to believing. The grief that came with that belief was immense. I have made both major and minor lifestyle changes since, one being that I simply no longer feel comfortable flying.

I can’t fly knowing I’m choosing to use my privilege in a way that will hurt others now and into the future. To me a flight is not worth the loss of human and nonhuman lives. For me, it’s that deep.

I used to work as an international model, which involved a huge amount of air travel. When I stopped flying I took trains and buses instead. Sometimes getting to a job took more than a day and sometimes, because flights are so subsidised, I had to fork out of my own pocket to cover the extra travel expenses that clients wouldn’t.

I used my privileges of time and capital. I chose to pay personally for my travel, in time and money, over cost to other future and present lives on Earth.

The most epic trip I took by bus and train was from London to Berlin, then from Berlin to a permaculture project in a town outside Seville, then back to London via Berlin. It became a sort of pilgrimage. I learned to live in the journey rather than the destination. 

I saw so much of Europe, met kind travellers. Out of the train window, I waved at strangers, saw sunsets on marshlands with flamingos in France and sunrises over dusty hills in Spain. I went from autumn in North Germany to summer in Southern Spain, I saw the seasons changing on the earth as I moved. I heard languages change around me, felt culture shift, tasted foods change. 

### This experience of travel connected me to place. I felt the size of the Earth and all the people filling her. She felt small and homey.

### If aviation transformed overnight into a carbon-negative industry, I’d still choose to travel on land.
