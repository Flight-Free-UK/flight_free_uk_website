It is easy to become bogged down in doom and gloom when it comes to climate change, especially when there seems to be increasing amounts of devastating climate disasters happening all across the globe.

This is why I have decided to sign the Flight Free 2022 pledge. By making an individual stance alongside thousands of like-minded people who are also worried about the effects of climate change, signing the pledge feels like a step towards hope and a better future for our planet.

By following the Flight Free UK campaign in 2021, I learned more about the climate impact of aviation than I ever imagined I could. Not only did I learn so much, but it also exposed me to a whole new community of people dedicated to fighting for the climate, challenging the government, and finding alternative ways to travel across the world.

Of course, signing the flight free pledge hasn’t solved my eco-anxiety (it will take a lot to solve that!) but it does show that there are people out there who do care, and are passionate enough to want to make a difference. In the fight against the climate crisis, every little action matters.
