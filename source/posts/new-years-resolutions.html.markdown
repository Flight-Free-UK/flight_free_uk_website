## How do you feel about New Year’s Resolutions? Are they a welcome stimulus to self improvement, a source of optimism and excitement? Or do you groan at the thought, already anticipating the day you break your resolution and feel guilty?

At Flight Free UK we love a New Year’s resolution. The flight free movement started with [Maja Rosén’s New Year’s resolution](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/the-best-new-years-resolution-ever/) that, when people told her about their flights, she would talk to them about the climate. From that sprang the campaign to ask 100,000
Swedes to stop flying for a year. We believe that taking a flight free year is
absolutely the best New Year’s resolution you can make.

This time last year we were asking people if taking the Flight Free 2020 pledge
could be their New Year’s resolution. Of course, no one could have predicted
what happened next. Record numbers of people stayed grounded, but not
through choice. By all accounts it has been a miserable year, and we totally
understand people wanting to get out of here at the first opportunity.

But before you click ‘book’ on that flight, could you make a different choice?

Depending on how much you fly normally, not flying will make more difference
to your carbon footprint than almost anything else. Forgoing just one long-haul
flight would have more benefit than even a really demanding resolution like
going vegan. (Of course, you can do both. All areas of our emissions need to come
down, and reducing the amount of meat and dairy you consume is very much
worth doing too.)

And while your heart might sink at the thought of having to stay put in 2021 too,
the good news is that there are lots of fabulous destinations within reach. The
spectacular British coastline, historic European cities, the Alps, even
Mediterranean resorts, can all be enjoyed without flying.

In 2020 we’ve had a chance to reflect on what’s important to us. We’ve kept in
touch with friends and family without the need for high-carbon transport. Family
Zooms aren’t ideal, but they can be part of the mix. We’ve been forced to explore
our own neighbourhoods and take pleasure in the nature on our doorsteps, and
it has helped us to feel grounded. This year, when you travel, make the journey
part of your adventure. Spend less time stressing at the airport and more time
gazing out of the window. Savour the journey and chill.

And you won’t be alone. Sticking to a New Year’s resolution is much easier if you
do it with someone else. If you pledge to be flight free you will have the support
of thousands of like-minded people. And if you talk to your friends about your
pledge, there are good reasons to think they might fly less too. It’s a social
contagion, which is so much better than a viral one!
