I enjoy travelling and immersing myself into different cultures and seeing the idyllic views. 

Like for many other people, flying for me had just become the ‘default’ option to travel – it’s convenient, quick and cheap. Other options just didn’t seem possible or realistic in comparison. I’m fully aware of the climate crisis and the environmental issues caused by aviation, but I never really gave a second thought to jumping on a plane to go on holiday – it just became the norm. 

> "Society pushes us towards booking flights without thinking about the consequences."

I signed the pledge to commit to taking a conscious step back and re-evaluating my approach to travel. The climate crisis isn’t going away, so it needs to be treated as the global health emergency it is. Staying grounded is a simple lifestyle change that can actually benefit. 

> "On reflection, it doesn’t feel right to be able to travel so quickly and so cheaply." 

Ultimately, there is no such thing as a “cheap” flight – the hidden costs of our excessive consumption will eventually catch up with us.

Becoming flight free doesn’t mean I have to give up travelling. It’s given me a new perspective. I can become more mindful in terms of travel.

> "The journey can become part of the adventure and the whole experience can become more enriching."

Flight Free UK has made me think beyond just flights. Now I think about the bigger problems and all the little changes I can make to truly become more sustainable. I’m trying to move away from the norm, and hopefully this will help others reflect and alter their lifestyles to be more sustainable.
