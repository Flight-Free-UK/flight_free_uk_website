## Why travel by train?

### Trains are the ultimate in no-fly travel: fast and efficient, they can transport you quickly from one country to the next with none of the space restriction or discomfort of a flight. Typically bringing you direct to the city centre, you can disembark and jump straight into your holiday without worrying about lengthy and expensive transfers.

##### Plug sockets, wifi and tables mean you can spend your time working, reading, sleeping or anything you choose. You can get up and go to the cafe bar or toilet at any time, or you can bring your own picnic and start your holiday in style. A train journey is something to be enjoyed, rather than endured.

And that’s before we get to the views! Seeing the landscape steadily change out of the window enriches the journey and enhances your understanding and anticipation of the place you are travelling towards in a way that doesn’t happen with other forms of travel. It is nostalgic, but at the same time, completely modern. 

To top it off, the emissions savings are huge. On average, trains in the UK emit 6 times less CO2 than the equivalent flight, and on the continent, where most trains are electrified, the emissions are 10 times less.

For short-haul flights, the time taken travelling is about the same as the train equivalent by the time you have factored in check-in and transfers. We are firmly of the opinion there are no disadvantages to travelling by train – only advantages!

## Cost

Trains do often cost more than planes, especially when considering all the dirt-cheap flights out there. However, it’s not always cheaper to fly, and there are some important things to remember about train travel and cost:

* air travel is exempt from tax, making it artificially cheap
* when you factor in transfers, luggage costs etc, the price of the flight gets much closer to the cost of the train
* bear in mind that when you fly, you're paying for a small seat and a generally unpleasant experience, but with a train your money gets you leg room, the ability to get up and move around whenever you like, and great views
* you might be paying for more than one transport provider e.g. if you have to change trains, whereas the flight will just be one airline, so naturally the cost will be higher

Having said all that, it is very possible to get cheap fares! 

* Book in advance
* Try [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/en) (see below)
* [Split your ticket ](https://www.splitmyfare.co.uk)
* Use slower, local trains

## Eurostar

If you're travelling by train to the continent, chances are your journey will begin with the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en) (unless you cross to continental Europe on the ferry, then continue by train – see ‘[how to travel by ferry](/post/how-to-travel-by-ferry/)’ for help with that). 

The Eurostar is fantastic – easy check-in, comfortable seating, and fast, efficient and reliable travel to Paris, Lille, Brussels or Amsterdam ([but not in 2024](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/06/05/eurostars-london-amsterdam-trains-to-be-suspended-for-almost-a-year-from-2024)). Cheap fares are available in advance, though they can be very limited. 

It's possible to travel to London from anywhere in the UK in one day, and there are [cheap accommodation options](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/greater-london/london/hub-london-kings-cross.html) near St Pancras station to facilitate onward travel by Eurostar the following day. Or you could split the journey in Paris (expensive), Lille (much cheaper!) or Brussels, ready to continue the next day.

## O﻿nwards travel by high speed train

Like in the UK, countries in continental Europe offer high-speed/intercity trains or local/regional trains. In France this is the TGV, in Italy it’s Frecciarossa, in Spain it’s AVE, in Germany ICE. These trains make it very easy to get around in comfort and style.

High speed trains always require an advanced booking, both in the UK and abroad, and you might find some restriction on luggage and bicycles.

By high speed train it's possible to reach Berlin, Barcelona or Milan in a single day from the UK.

## Onwards travel by regional train

Local trains are a great option if you want to explore a single country rather than travel across the continent. They are usually cheaper, with no booking required, and you can bring bikes and as much luggage as you like, though the seating is not usually quite as comfortable as high-speed trains and there are limited facilities. But it’s a fantastic option for exploring at lower speed and low cost.

## Sleeper trains

Travelling while you sleep is a great way to make the most of your time and money. There is now an extensive network of sleeper trains across Europe, including two routes in the UK: the [Caledonian Sleeper](https://www.sleeper.scot/) from Scotland to London and the [Night Riviera](https://www.gwr.com/travelling-with-us/night-riviera-sleeper) between London and Plymouth. 

On the continent, look for [Nightjet](https://www.nightjet.com/en/) (Austrian railways linking Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy), [European Sleeper](https://www.europeansleeper.eu/en) (Brussels-Berlin), and others on this page: <https://www.seat61.com/sleepers.htm> 

Prices vary depending on whether you go for a berth (full bed), a couchette (bunk beds that fold down from the walls) or a seat, but it's always a bargain compared to a hotel. 

## Interrail

Far from just being a gap-year rite-of-passage for students, the [Interrail pass](https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass) is a terrific way to see Europe at a bargain price. A pass could reduce the cost of your travel even if you are only going to one destination.

Go to the [Interrail website](https://www.interrail.eu/en) for the options, which include anything from country passes to month-long passes for travel across all 33 Interrail countries. The pass includes travel within your home country as long as you enter Europe on the same day.

UK residents can buy an Interrail pass (it is for residents of Europe, which we are, geographically if not politically). Overseas visitors would need to buy a Eurail pass.

## Finding routes and buying tickets

The encyclopaedic website [The Man in Seat 61](http://seat61.com) gives information about travelling to every country in the world without flying, and comes highly recommended. The site will tell you everything you need to know, with maps, pictures of the trains, information on cost and tickets, and tips on making the journey flow smoothly. 

[RailEurope](https://www.raileurope.com/) will sell you tickets for most rail journeys across Europe, regardless of the rail provider. You can also set alerts with Rail Europe that will let you know when tickets go on sale. The [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/) is also a great place to buy tickets for multi-country travel.

Alternatively, go direct to the train provider websites: SNCF (France), Deutsche Bahn (Germany), Renfe (Spain), Trenitalia (Italy) or OBB (Austria) (see [seat61.com](http://seat61.com) for others).

## Connections 

Speak to your train conductor if you have a connection to make, especially if you don't have long to make it. They will probably be able to tell you the platform you need to go to. Sometimes if the train you're on is delayed, they will hold your connecting train for you, or at least accept your ticket on the next one. 

In most cities, there’s only one train station so it’s just a matter of changing platform. In some bigger cities you might have to change. Here’s some advice for getting across Paris.
