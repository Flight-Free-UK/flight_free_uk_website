I am a scientist. After seeing the smogs of Beijing, I changed my career from teaching maths to researching air quality. I found that the air up to 20 miles around airports can be highly polluted with 'ultrafine particles' that are hazardous to health.

I love to travel. I lived in three different countries and I even wrote a book about a trip I took to North Korea! But after learning about the environmental cost of flying I couldn’t legitimise it any more. 

> #### "The planes I used to take burnt through 4 litres of fuel per second. That’s totally nuts. No offsetting schemes come close to making that ok."

I grieved the travel to South America that I will never do, and seeing my sister in Canada, but I have replaced it with train travel adventure. 

I converted my Avios to Eurostar points and I enjoy the prospect of getting to know the treasures of places closer to home. 

> #### "I don’t need to get on a plane to have adventures, and flights are far too cheap due to tax loopholes." 

I’m happy to spend the money to travel by train. Travel will therefore be less frequent but more meaningful.
