## Sarah and I spent our early twenties adventuring around the world and catching lots of flights.

### But it was on these trips overseas when we truly saw some of the horrific environmental damage taking place around the world.

Slowly, we started making more and more changes to lead lower-impact lifestyles – changing our shopping habits, embracing second-hand, going vegan – and then we realised how disastrous flying was for the natural world. 

In life, we believe you’ve got to practice what you preach and lead by example, so, in 2017 we took our last flight and haven’t looked back since. 

To begin with, we were worried it would hinder exploration or our outdoor passions, but it’s actually done the complete opposite. We’ve become obsessed with human-powered adventures and quickly realised the real excitement is in the journey, rather than the destination. That’s something you can easily forget with today’s simplistic flying culture. 

Since we clipped our wings, we’ve completed the UK Three Peaks Challenge by bike (instead of driving) and began a UK to India cycling challenge. 

### Stopping flying actually opened a world of possibilities and it’s a decision we’re proud to have made.
