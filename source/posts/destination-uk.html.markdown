### England

#### Camber Sands

The UK isn’t short on stunning coastline, but Camber Sands is a favourite destination due to its golden sands, gently shelving beach and warm waters. Camber is also home to the only sand dunes in East Sussex - big enough to get lost in. The beach is a popular [windsurfing/kitesurfing](https://ryewatersports.co.uk/) spot and it’s close to a train station and the historic town of [Rye](https://www.timeout.com/rye/things-to-do/a-perfect-day-in-rye). Unfortunately, the attractiveness of Camber Sands means that it gets really busy; roads are a car park on sunny days. Avoid the crowds by catching the train to Rye and cycling the handful of miles along the traffic-free cycle way right to the beach.

#### Lake District

It’s an obvious one but it’s got to go on the list. The Lake District is fantastic for lovers of outdoor pursuits - [mountain biking](https://www.pure-leisure.co.uk/10-best-mountain-biking-routes-lake-district/), road cycling, walking, climbing, [boating](https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/water) and more. The lakes each have their own character and the surrounding mountains make for an absolutely breathtaking view. Although the climbs are hard work on a bike, they’re always rewarding. Towns such as Windermere, Ambleside, Kendal and Keswick, although touristy, offer a wide range of shops, pubs, cafes, restaurants and museums. There’s also plenty of villages that offer experiences a bit more off the beaten track. Access to and around the Lake District is easiest by car, but is perfectly possible by train and bus.

#### Wiltshire

In the north of the county, [water sports](https://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/things-to-do/activities/water-fun) amateurs can try their hand at wakeboarding, [canoeing](https://www.waterpark.org/things-to-do/watersports/canoeingkayaking/), kayaking or [sailing](https://www.waterpark.org/things-to-do/watersports/sailing/) in the Cotswold Water Park, which features 150 lakes alone. For those looking for more tranquility, hire a [narrowboat](http://www.wiltshire-narrowboats.co.uk/) and cruise down the UK’s extensive network of inland waterways. Further south in Wiltshire is the Kennet and Avon canal – a beautiful natural corridor that offers a unique perspective of the pretty towns en route. After a day floating at an average 5 mph, stop at one of the many pubs for a refreshing drink or hearty meal.

#### Isles of Scilly

This enchanting archipelago off the toe of Cornwall is formed of five inhabited islands in addition to countless uninhabited ones, some of which remain completely undisturbed. Hop around each island on a “tripper” [boat](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/island-hopping), hire a [bike](https://www.stmarysbikehire.co.uk/) or get your walking boots out to truly experience this English paradise. Each island offers a unique experience, but the Isles are well known for their creative communities, sweeping sea views, sandy beaches, ancient architecture and fascinating wildlife. Travelling to the Isles flight-free is easy and a perfect way to view the Cornish coastline: take the train to Penzance then the ferry to Scilly.

#### Jurassic Coast

England’s first natural UNESCO World Heritage Site begins at Orcombe Point in Exmouth and runs for 95 miles to Old Harry Rocks, Dorset. Some of England’s most impressive landscapes are found along the Jurassic Coast, including the iconic limestone arch Durdle Door and the chalk cliffs at Beer. There’s plenty of activities to enjoy, from [coasteering](http://www.lulworthoutdoors.com/activities/coasteering/) at Lulworth Cove for the adrenaline-junkies to short walks along the [South West Coast Path](https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/), a stunning route which combines views of dramatic sea cliffs and lush countryside. For those seeking cycling routes, many of the towns and villages along the Jurassic Coast are connected along the [National Cycle Network](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network). Finally, don’t leave the Jurassic Coast before spending some time [fossil hunting](https://jurassiccoast.org/visit/fossil-collecting/) on the beaches between Charmouth and Lyme Regis. During peak times, travel by public transport to landmarks or walk/cycle to avoid circling car parks.

#### Dartmouth

Devon is a wonderful holiday location, boasting great weather and a huge range of attractions and activities. The colourful town of Dartmouth is situated on the banks of the River Dart, one of the most beautiful rivers in England. There’s Kingswear on one side of the River Dart and Dartmouth on the other, with a castle on either headland guarding the entrance. For those seeking fresh air and an escape from the hustle of city life - there’s no better place. Get [walking](https://www.discoverdartmouth.com/blog/2017/8/11/walks-in-dartmouth-a2489) to explore the stunning south Devon countryside and south west coast. It’s quite an adventure to access by rail: take the train to Paignton via Exeter (stop and explore Devon’s county town if you have time), enjoy the [steam train](https://www.dartmouthrailriver.co.uk/) to Kingswear, then take the ferry across to Dartmouth (included in the price of your steam train ticket).

### Scotland

#### Edinburgh

We’ve got to include the Scottish capital! It’s an awesome city nestled within great expanses of nature. Edinburgh is great for history explorers: visit the iconic [Edinburgh Castle](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/edinburgh-castle-p245821) which sits on the peak of an extinct volcano; and don’t miss a trip to the [National Museum of Scotland](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/national-museum-of-scotland-p246591) to view collections celebrating the nation’s culture, history and people. Wake up early to climb Arthur’s Seat and take in the panoramic views of the city at sunrise. National Express can get you to Edinburgh for a tenner, or take the train to experience the spectacular views of the East Coast railway line.

#### Isle of Skye

The largest island of the Inner Hebrides, the Isle of Skye is excellent for walking and climbing, with hikes to the Fairy Pools and Old Man of Storr not to be missed. Take a [boat trip](https://www.isleofskye.com/activities/boat-trips) from Portree to spot otters, seals, dolphins, whales and sea eagles, or for more tranquility [kayak](https://www.seakayakplockton.co.uk/) around Plockton’s beautiful sheltered bays. The Clan Castles allow visitors to delve into the rich history of Skye and the many [museums](http://www.skyemuseum.co.uk/) offer a fascinating insight into island life. Travelling flight free is easy: take the [train](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/) to Maillaig from Glasgow, then the ferry to Skye, or from Inverness to Kyle with a bus onto the island. There are also [coaches](https://www.citylink.co.uk/) that go from both Glasgow and Inverness to Skye .

### Wales

#### Porthmadog

Known as the Gateway to Snowdonia, the town of Porthmadog is flanked on one side by the ‘Moel y Gest’ mountain, while wide expanses of the Glaslyn estuary extend towards the north and east to the Snowdon range. The town itself has a busy and friendly atmosphere, with a good range of shops and attractions. Home to the Ffestiniog Railway, the Welsh Highland Railway and the smaller Welsh Highland Heritage Railway, you’ll find no better place for [steam train](https://www.festrail.co.uk/) enthusiasts. Alternatively, visit the town’s [Maritime Museum](https://porthmadog.wales/the-porthmadog-maritime-museum/) to delve into Porthmadog’s history as a thriving slate exporting and shipbuilding port. The town sits on the edge of the remote and beautiful Llŷn peninsula and is accessible on [Arriva Trains Wales](http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/) from Shrewsbury.

#### Pembrokeshire

For wild and strikingly beautiful landscapes, you can’t beat Pembrokeshire. Along the shores you’ll find the [Pembrokeshire Coast Path](https://www.visitpembrokeshire.com/explore-pembrokeshire/coast-path), an 186-mile trail that meanders through more than 50 beaches as well as coves, harbours, towns, villages and the smallest city in the UK - St Davids. The rocky coastline is surrounded by the sea on three sides, which makes it great for water sports in addition to activities such as cycling and [rock climbing](https://www.visitpembrokeshire.com/activities-adventure/rock-climbing). For birdwatchers, catch a [boat](http://www.pembrokeshire-islands.co.uk/boat-trips/) to view the puffins on Skomer Island or tens of thousands of gannets on Grassholm Island. Don’t miss a trip up to north Pembrokeshire in autumn to view hundreds of Atlantic grey seal pups! Access to the county is easiest by car (e.g. to St Davids) or take a train to Tenby and begin your holiday on the golden beaches.
