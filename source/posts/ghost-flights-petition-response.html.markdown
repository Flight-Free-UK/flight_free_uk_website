### ‘Ghost flights’ is the term used to refer to planes flying empty or at very low capacity.

##### Airlines have always operated ghost flights in order to move aircraft around, or for training purposes, but during the Covid pandemic it was revealed that some airlines were operating thousands of empty flights in order to retain their lucrative landing slots. 

The government rules state that airlines must use their landing slots 80% of the time in order to keep them. This was relaxed during the pandemic, but even so, [a reported 15,000 ghost flights](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/ghost-flights-from-uk-running-at-500-a-month-data-reveals) left the UK between the start of the Covid pandemic in March 2020 and September 2021.

We ran [a petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/605749) asking the government to change the rules so that airlines didn’t have to keep planes in the air to retain their slots at times of low demand. 

Nearly 17,000 people signed the petition, prompting a reply from the government. 

You can read the government’s response in full on the [Parliamentary Petitions website](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/605749), but here are the highlights:

* the Government suspended the rules for the summer 2020, winter 2020/21 and summer 2021 seasons
* the UK’s exit from the EU means that the UK government has been able to take a more tailored approach to slot rules
* the Government is keen to support airline recovery after the pandemic
* the ratio of slot-use will be 70%, with provisions for justified non-utilisation of slots, which will  avoid the environmental impact of empty or almost empty flights flying where COVID-19 related restrictions are in place
* as part of the Government’s future aviation policy it is actively looking at reform to the airport slot allocation process
* the Government recognises that the aviation sector has a critical role to play in delivering the UK’s net zero commitments. In July 2021 it published the Jet Zero Consultation which sets out the Government’s vision for the sector to reach net zero by 2050. 
* the Government is already supporting a variety of technology, fuel and market-based measures to address aviation emissions. Jet Zero aims for the UK to become a world-leader in zero emission flight and to build a world-leading sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The Government announced £180 million of additional funding for the development of SAF plants in the UK, further supporting our ambition to see 10% SAF blended into the UK fuel mix by 2030.

Never miss a chance to shoehorn in Brexit! It's interesting that the Government is comparing its slot alleviation favourably to the EU. The EU currently requires slots to be used at 64%, a figure kinder to airlines and kinder to the planet. 

There are other systems that can be put in place to ensure that airport capacity is used effectively, and that won't result in empty planes in the air. 

Justified non-utilisation of slots sounds fair, and sounds as though it could genuinely prevent airlines flying planes for no reason.

However! While the slot allocation was zero, [almost 15,000 planes flew at 10% capacity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/almost-15000-ghost-flights-left-uk-since-pandemic-began) or below. How many more will fly when the slot allocation reaches 70%?

With demand still below ‘normal' capacity, this means that airlines might still end up flying empty planes. 

[Not even the industry](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airline-slots-heathrow-airport-ghost-flights-b1999038.html) is happy:

> “The UK government decision on slots, proposing the highest slot use threshold in the world, makes a mockery of their claims to be supporting the recovery of the airline industry and to be champions of the environment.
>
> “It is inconceivable that international demand will average 70 per cent this summer. The government is therefore condemning airlines to operate thousands of flights at low capacity which is environmentally stupid.” 

*~ Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata)*

In any case, even in ‘normal’ times planes still sometimes fly empty to keep slots, and have done for years.

The Government has been saying that they are actively looking at reform to the airport slot allocation process since 2018 and so far no progress has been made.

The Jet Zero strategy is woefully inadequate as a way of dealing with the climate impact of aviation. [Our response is here](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/whats-wrong-with-jet-zero/).

SAF is an excellent example of how Jet Zero plans sound nice but will achieve very little.

SAF usage at 10% is extremely low, and means 90% of the fuel is still fossil fuel. Regulation, speed of development and cost mean that it’s unlikely ever to be above 50%.

In any case, [there is very little that's ‘sustainable' about Sustainable Aviation Fuel](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/the-trouble-with-saf/). The options include biofuel from purpose-grown crops, which is a leading driver of deforestation. Reclaimed biofuel from used cooking oil, or making crude oil from waste plastic sounds better, but this diverts attention away from reducing plastic waste in the first place.

The trouble is that all of these fuels still produce the same amount of greenhouse gas when burned. The emissions ‘savings' come from preventing emissions earlier in the chain, which is difficult to quantify.

E-fuel or synthetic fuel is potentially the closest to a zero carbon fuel, but e-fuels are very energy intensive, and will take renewable energy from other uses which are arguably more important, for example, decarbonising our road transport and the grid. 

In addition to SAF, Jet Zero relies on technology that is not ready yet. It also relies heavily on offsetting, and [we explore that minefield here.](https://flightfree.co.uk/post/podcast-series-episode-5-carbon-offsets-and-green-technology/)

> “Carbon offsetting allows us to keep indulging rather than change behaviour. When you consider the justice issues affecting indigenous communities in terms of land displacement, we can't offset with a clear conscience.”
