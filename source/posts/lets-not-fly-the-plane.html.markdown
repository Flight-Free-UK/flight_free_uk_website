On April 19th 2019 we attempted a flashmob at Stansted Airport. However, they don't take kindly to singing in the airport terminal and we were asked quite promptly to leave. Not to be outdone, we took to the far less lofty setting of Sarah's Back Garden and recorded the song anyway. Not quite as slick but just as silly!

Go to our [Facebook videos page](https://www.facebook.com/flightfreeUK/videos/) to watch the video of us singing "Let's not fly the plane!" to the tune of "Let's go fly a kite" from Mary Poppins. 

### Let's Not Fly the Plane lyrics

*With climate change happ'ning so fast,*

*You all might very well ask:* 

*'Oh what can I do? There's no cure in sight!'* 
*But have you ever thought of not taking that flight?*  

(oh, oh, oh)

*Let's not fly the plane up in the air again!* 

*Let's not fly the plane or send it soaring* 

*Up! It's so damaging!* 

*Up! It's the darnedest thing!* 

*Oh, let's not fly the plane.*  

__

*When you send it flying up there* 

*All it does is pollute the air,* 

*With our climate so fragile we need to fight* 

*With our endless desire to take all of these flights.*  

(oh, oh, oh)

*Let's not take that flight up to the highest height!* 

*Let's not take that flight, just heed the warning,* 

*Up goes the CO2!*  

*Up, yes it's up to you* 

*To say 'No!' to the flight!*
