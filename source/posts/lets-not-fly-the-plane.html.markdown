After our attempted flashmob at Stansted Airport was thwarted (apparently they don't take kindly to singing in the airport terminal) we took to the far less lofty setting of Sarah's Back Garden and recorded the song anyway. Not quite as slick but just as silly!

_With climate change happ'ning so fast,_ 

_You all might very well ask:_ 

_'Oh what can I do? There's no cure in sight!'_ 

_But have you ever thought of not taking that flight?_  

__

_Let's not fly the plane up in the air again!_ 

_Let's not fly the plane or send it soaring_ 

_Up! It's so damaging!_ 

_Up! It's the darnedest thing!_ 

_Oh, let's not fly the plane._  

__

_When you send it flying up there_ 

_All it does is pollute the air,_ 

_With our climate so fragile we need to fight_ 

_With our endless desire to take all of these flights._  

__

_Let's not take that flight up to the highest height!_ 

_Let's not take that flight, just heed the warning,_ 

_Up goes the CO2!_  

_Up, yes it's up to you_ 

_To say 'No!' to the flight!_
