### England

#### Devizes, Wiltshire

Known as “Wiltshire’s hidden gem”, Devizes is a medieval market town with a plethora of shops, hotels, pubs and eateries. There’s a working Victorian [brewery](https://www.wadworth.co.uk/visitor-centre/) which runs tours and tastings, in addition to three ancient churches and two museums (including the award-winning [Wiltshire Museum](https://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/)). Devizes is a perfect base from which to explore the surrounding area by foot, bicycle or public transport. For a unique and relaxing holiday experience, we recommend hiring a [narrowboat](https://www.abcboathire.com/our-routes/short-breaks/hilperton-marina/devizes-return) on the Kennet and Avon canal.

Not only is the canal a remarkable feat of engineering, with tunnels, aqueducts and the famous lock flight at [Caen Hill](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/places-to-visit/caen-hill-locks) (29 locks in a row!), floating at an average 5 mph is a truly relaxing way to pass the time. There are plenty of canalside pubs along the way; we particularly like the [Black Horse](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g528767-d5918051-Reviews-Black_Horse-Devizes_Wiltshire_England.html) at Devizes, near the top of the Caen Hill flight. By public transport, take the train to Swindon or Salisbury and then catch a bus to Devizes.

#### Sheringham, Norfolk

The traditional seaside town of Sheringham is known for its beautiful sandy beach, heritage steam railway (the [North Norfolk Railway](https://www.nnrailway.co.uk/)), local produce (don’t miss the twice-weekly [market](http://visitsheringham.co.uk/listing/sheringham-open-air-market/)) and excellent coastal and countryside walking routes. Visit the countryside of Upper Sheringham (including [Sheringham Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sheringham-park)) to experience beautiful views of the North Norfolk coast, peaceful woodlands and uplands covered with miles of purple heather and yellow gorse. The Norfolk Coast Path runs through the majority of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; from Sheringham, try a six-mile circular [route](https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/out-and-about-in-norfolk/norfolk-trails/short-and-circular-walks/norfolk-coast-path) that traces the coast and then meanders through parkland, ancient oak woodland, fen and grassland in Beeston Common and the rhododendrons of Sheringham Park.

The town is accessible by train, and if you have time, stop off at Cromer on the way - another Norfolk seaside town rich in fishing heritage.

#### Edale, Peak District

Edale is located in the heart of the Peak District and is the official start/end of the UK’s first long-distance walking route – the [Pennine Way](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/pennine-way/). It’s a tiny village, or to be more accurate, a collection of small hamlets or “booths” and is popular with walkers of all abilities. Edale is close to the [Blue John Cavern](https://www.bluejohn-cavern.co.uk) at Castleton, a famous site for the ornamental mineral Blue John stone. Take a 45-minute guided tour through the water-worn cave system to view the stone in its natural state, along with stalactites, stalagmites and huge caverns.

For local amenities, Edale has two pubs, two cafes, a few local shops, several B&Bs, holiday lets and camping sites. Edale train station is accessed by one of England’s most beautiful railway routes: the Manchester to Sheffield train line ([the Hope Valley Line](https://www.scenicrailbritain.com/lines/hope-valley-line)). On this journey, you’ll pass rugged hills and dales, historic viaducts and quaint villages with grey-brick cottages. From Edale, there’s the option to take the train to Buxton and other Peak District villages.

#### Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria

Grange-over-Sands is a small coastal town located along the fascinating Morecambe Bay and just outside the Lake District park boundary. The town itself is a great base for [walking](https://www.grangeoversandstowncouncil.gov.uk/walking-and-cycling.html) and cycling, with routes around the town perfect for nature enthusiasts and bird-watchers. There are several [nature reserves](https://www.visitcumbria.com/nature-reserves/) and sites of special scientific interest, while Morecambe Bay offers opportunities to spot oystercatchers or lazy seals. For a relaxing afternoon, potter around Grange’s pretty waterside shops and cafes; we recommend the lovely [Hazelmere Cafe and Bakery](https://thehazelmere.co.uk/) for delicious regional specialities like Eccles cakes, Cumberland rum Nicky and Yorkshire curd tarts, all baked to a secret recipe.

Grange-over-Sands is accessible by train from Ulverston and Barrow-in-Furness to the west and from Lancaster, Preston and Manchester in the east.

#### Isles of Scilly, Cornwall

This enchanting archipelago off the toe of Cornwall is formed of five inhabited islands in addition to countless uninhabited ones, some of which remain completely undisturbed. Hop around each island on a “tripper” [boat](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/island-hopping), take a swim in the refreshing waters (don’t forget your [wetsuit](https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/united-kingdom/isles-of-scilly-july.htm)!), or [snorkel with the seals](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/experience/things-to-do/scilly-seal-snorkelling-p1148703) to truly experience this English paradise.

Each island offers a unique experience, but the Isles are well known for their creative communities, sweeping sea views, ancient architecture and fascinating wildlife. We've got to mention the [beaches](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/beaches) - with turquoise shallow waters, palm trees and pale, fine sand - there’s no need to go further afield. Scilly’s beaches are gorgeous enough to rival any in the world, and there are more than 35 across the archipelago. Head to Great Bay on St Martin’s (voted best beach in the UK) for swimming, Porth Loo Beach on St Mary’s for rock pooling, or Gimble Porth on Tresco for a beach all to yourself.

Travelling to the Isles flight-free is easy and a perfect way to view the Cornish coastline: take the train to Penzance then the ferry to St Mary's, the largest island of the group.

The town is steeped in history - legend has it one of the Spanish Armada ships sank in the bay in 1588. Take a visit to the [Mull Museum](http://www.mullmuseum.org.uk/) to explore the history of Mull and its people. The island capital is a great place for wildlife watching, as the coastal seas are important feeding grounds for whales, dolphins, otters, basking sharks and eagles.
