## Decarbonising aviation is a huge challenge, and one that the industry is throwing lots of money and innovation at.

#### But are new technological developments going to be effective in bringing aviation emissions down?

We take a look at some of the developments on the horizon.

#### Electric planes

Electrification is touted as the best way to decarbonise most modes of transport, and aviation is no exception. Electric planes of varying types and sizes, including solar planes, have been presented by many of the big players in the industry including [Rolls Royce](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-60068786).

The first consideration is that electric transportation is not without environmental and human cost, with significant resources going into making batteries, and the sourcing of materials often involving human rights abuses and child exploitation. 

Of course, this is [nowhere near as high](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/mining-low-carbon-vs-fossil) as the resources (and human rights abuses) used for fossil fuel extraction, but is still an important consideration.

Secondly, flights would only be 'carbon neutral' if the electricity were to come from renewable sources. Estimates suggest that we would need to more than double our renewable energy output to meet demand for electric aviation. 

This begs the question of whether using renewables for aviation is the best use of an already scarce power source. Priorities for renewables should be decarbonising the grid and electrifying the road fleet, with aviation right at the bottom of the list.

In practical terms, the size and weight of the batteries (which don't get lighter the further you travel, unlike fuel tanks) means that electric planes would be able to take a [much smaller number of passengers than current aircraft](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/aviation-electric-planes-climate-change/), and the range capacity means that they would only ever be suitable for short-haul travel.

Given that we already have a short-haul method of electric travel – the train – it feels that any investment would be better spent on the rail network.

Electric planes have their place, for example on short-hop flights such as those in the Highlands and Islands, but they will never be suitable for large-scale commercial aviation.
