## I﻿n order to reach our legally-binding target of net zero by 2050, emissions from aviation need to fall.

#### H﻿ere at Flight Free UK we focus on individual behaviour change, but that must go hand in hand with effective government policy if we are to achieve the necessary emissions reductions.

Here are our top policies for a UK government to adopt, to help get a grip on emissions from aviation.

#### 1. A moratorium on airport expansion

A﻿cross the UK, 20 airports have expansion plans. Each one claims the expansion will fit within our emissions reduction goals, even though the plans would result in a [59% increase in passenger numbers](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-planned-growth-of-uk-airports-not-consistent-with-net-zero-climate-goal/)c﻿ontributing a further 8 mega-tonnes of CO2 annually into the atmosphere.

A﻿irports are adept at reassuring policy makers that they can grow in a low-carbon way, mainly by pointing towards carbon neutral ground operations, improvements in fuel efficiency, and more people taking the train to the airport. 

E﻿missions from flights themselves are consistently left out of airport expansion plans.

T﻿he Climate Change Committee states that there should be no net expansion across the UK if we are to meet our climate targets. The government should take this advice and adopt a national policy to stop all airport expansion.

#### 2﻿. Tax aviation fuel

Currently, there is no tax on kerosene (aviation fuel), meaning that flights are often artificially cheap especially when compared to overland transport such as trains. The playing field needs to be levelled with VAT on plane tickets and a kerosene tax. It has been estimated that a tax on aviation fuel in Europe would cut both [passenger numbers and emissions by 11%](https://www.ft.com/content/1ce24798-733b-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15).

#### 3. Tax, not reward, frequent fliers

[70% of flights in the UK are taken by just 15% of the population](https://fullfact.org/economy/do-15-people-take-70-flights/). Introducing a frequent flyer levy would both incentivise people to fly less as well as ensuring that the polluter pays.

#### 4. Carbon labelling at time of booking

Flight booking websites should show average carbon emissions per passenger for each journey, compared to UK annual per person emissions. These ‘nudge’ measures can help consumers make informed choices and are similar to measures already used for items such as food.

#### 5. A ban on advertising for flights

When it became clear that smoking was a Public Health issue, the government banned the advertising of tobacco products. Air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation are an equal, if not worse, Public Health issue. A ban on advertising for airlines would contribute to the social shift away from aviation.

##### Stick or carrot?

While ‘stick’ measures such as these can lead to behaviour change, they should go hand in hand with ‘carrot’ measures such as: cheaper trains; more routes; and more obvious and user-friendly booking systems for overland travel.

The Committee on Climate Change says that if, instead of 25% growth, the UK could keep demand to 2018 levels, it would save 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2050. It says that it will take a change in consumer preference or social norms to achieve this, which is where campaigns like Flight Free UK come in. 

#### Government policy and individual action are not mutually exclusive. It will take both to get aviation's net emissions to zero by 2050.
