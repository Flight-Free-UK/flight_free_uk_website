**Thank you for signing up to be** [**Flight Free in 2020**](https://www.flightfree.co.uk/pledge)**. Can you sum up what motivated you to sign the pledge?**



An awareness that flying is in most cases entirely unnecessary and is massively damaging to the planet's health.

****

**How long have you been aware of climate issues?**



For many years. I gave up meat years ago after reading Diet for a Small Planet. I don't drive (never have) and have very rarely travelled.

****

**How often have you flown in the past?**



I am in my 60s and have only flown 11 times in my life, the last time 6 years ago.

****

**Only around 50% of the UK population actually flies, but most of the flights we do take are for leisure. What do you think would be the most effective thing in reducing them?**



Raising awareness of how damaging it is in the context of impacts on people's children and grandchildren's future. Making it reflect the real cost with added environmental taxes (sadly this will exclude the less wealthy from flying but can't be helped). Make full comparative info easily available about the CO2 emissions for different journeys and by different modes of transport.



**How will being flight-free next year affect your life?**



It just means no holidays outside the UK. A small price to pay considering.

****

**Is it daunting or exciting to have taken the pledge?**



I'm a little sad as I've seen so little of our beautiful world but it can't be helped.



What reaction do your friends and family have to you going flight free?



No surprise!

****

**What might you do to influence others to go flight free in 2020?**



Listen and talk to people about climate change.

****

**Thank you!**
