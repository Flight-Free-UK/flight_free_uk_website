## Why travel by coach?

C﻿oaches are generally seen as a great budget option, offering cheap travel across the UK and Europe. T﻿he downside of this is that the travel is seen as cheap, therefore not desirable. Though coaches have different comfort levels to trains, modern coaches are remarkably well-equipped, with surprisingly spacious and comfortable seating, plug sockets and wifi, and toilet facilities.

C﻿oach travel is also an excellent option for keeping emissions down: per person per journey, coaches produce five times less CO2 than air travel. That environmental saving comes with the fascinating bonus of being able to watch the scenery roll past beyond your window.

## F﻿lixbus

#### Coach tours

[Alfa Travel](https://www.alfatravel.co.uk/coach-holidays/) specialises in UK coach holidays, with a modern fleet of coaches and some lovely destinations to boot. 

#### Travelling overnight

Taking an overnight coach is the ultimate in budget travel, as you save on a hotel or hostel, and it can work out much cheaper than a sleeper train. It’s very rare you will get a bed, though, so it won’t be the most comfortable night’s sleep. 

A travel pillow, eye mask and earplugs can really help, and waking up in a new exciting destination will make all that tiredness disappear…  

## Tips for travelling by coach

* Book in advance and compare ticket prices across providers. This takes the stress out of travelling and the stress off the bank balance!
* Pack plenty of snacks. Most coach journeys will incorporate regular stop-offs at service stations, but even so, you don't want to be caught out.
* Virtually all coaches have charging points so you can take headphones / laptops safe in the knowledge you can keep them charged on the road.
* Wear comfortable clothes, take a travel pillow, and if you get restless when seated for even a short length of time, then try [these handy seated stretches](https://www.oxygenmag.com/workouts-for-women/stretching-workouts-for-women/5-seated-stretches-to-do-while-traveling/)!
