#### Coaches have come a long way since their horse-drawn namesakes of the early 1800’s.

#### Just as every good Sherlock Holmes adventure began with a coach arriving at 221b Baker Street, coaches today depart for a staggering number of locations across the UK and Europe and the potential for adventure is huge. ‘Come Watson, the game is afoot…’ 

## Why travel by coach?

Unlike in Sherlock’s time, there is no chance you’ll be asked to dismount whenever the road gets too rough, and of course there are no horses to feed. 

But that’s not the end of the benefits to travelling by modern coach. Comfortable, safe and timely, just one coach keeps around 50 cars off the road, and if coach journeys increased by just 15% per year in the UK we’d be seeing around 47 million fewer cars on our roads. And, contrary to popular belief, there are toilets onboard! 

But this is Flight Free UK, how do modern coaches compare to flying? Well, per person per journey, coaches produce five times less CO2 than air travel. That’s a staggering environmental saving and comes with the fascinating bonus of being able to watch the scenery roll past beyond your window. Ralph Waldo Emerson spoke wisely indeed with his advice to find the journey’s end in every step of the road!

## Companies, timetables and tickets

Coach travel is incredibly flexible; if you simply want to get from A to B then a company like [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en) will do that for you. However, if you fancy a coach tour where you travel from location to location whilst staying at hotels or B&B’s overnight, then a company like [Shearings](https://www.shearings.com/) has got you covered. 

[CheckMyBus](https://www.checkmybus.co.uk/) is a fantastic website that lets you search for coach and bus routes across many different providers letting you find the cheapest fees and giving plenty of date and time flexibility.

#### Travelling overnight

Taking an overnight coach is the ultimate in budget travel, as you save on a hotel or hostel, and they are much cheaper than a sleeper train. It’s very rare you will get a bed, though, so it won’t be the most comfortable night's sleep. A travel pillow, eye mask and earplugs can really help, and waking up in a new exciting destination will make all that tiredness disappear… 

## Tips for travelling by coach

* book in advance and compare ticket prices across providers. This takes the stress out of travelling and the stress off the bank balance!
* pack plenty of snacks. Most coach journeys will incorporate regular stop-offs at service stations, but even so, you don't want to be caught out.
* virtually all coaches have charging points so you can take headphones / laptops safe in the knowledge you can keep them charged on the road.
* wear comfortable clothes, take a travel pillow, and if you get restless when seated for even a short length of time, then try [these handy seated stretches](https://www.oxygenmag.com/workouts-for-women/stretching-workouts-for-women/5-seated-stretches-to-do-while-traveling/)!
