We are lucky to have the choice to live our lives in a manner that has a smaller negative impact on the environment. We live in Orta san Giulio, Italy, surrounded by beautiful nature, a lake, and a fair few hills. We want future generations to be able to see all this, not just humans.

> "We want future generations to be able to see all this, not just humans."

To try and minimise our contribution to climate change, we donâ€™t have a car; we use a cargo bike we designed and made ourselves, we eat a smaller amount of meat than previously, we try to repair and reuse rather than buy new, and as of a few years ago, we no longer fly.

These things are no sacrifice. Taking alternative means of transport rather than flights makes travel more fulfilling; cycling rather than using the car makes every trip feel like a small adventure, and it definitely keeps us fitter!
