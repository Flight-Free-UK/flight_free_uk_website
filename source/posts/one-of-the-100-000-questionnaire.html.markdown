Have you signed the flight free pledge? We'd love to hear from you! Simply answer the following questions and send them, along with a photo of yourself, to info@flightfree.co.uk, and we will upload them to our blog. Even better if it's a photo of you holding the [pledge card](https://www.flightfree.co.uk/resources)!



**Thank you for signing up to be Flight Free in 2020. Can you sum up what motivated you to sign the pledge?**

****

**How long have you been aware of climate issues?**



**How often have you flown in the past?**



**Only around 50% of the UK population actually flies, but most of the flights we do take are for leisure. What do you think would be the most effective thing in reducing them?**

****

**How will being flight-free next year affect your life? Do you have any plans for holidays or travel?**

****

**Is it daunting or exciting to have taken the pledge?** 

**What reaction do your friends and family have to you going flight free?**

****

**What might you do to influence others to go flight free in 2020?** 

****

**Thank you!**
