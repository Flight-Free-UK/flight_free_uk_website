I'm pledging to go flight free in 2022 because we need urgent, bold and ambitious action to curb carbon emissions. Flying was the most significant part of my carbon footprint before going flight free. 

> #### "Although we need people in positions of power to make far-reaching climate decisions, it's important to recognise the power of individual action."

Next year I'm planning a trip to Portugal to visit family. I'll take the Eurostar to Paris and will spend the evening strolling the upper heights of Montmartre. In the morning it'll be on to Barcelona and Madrid, where I'll stop off for a few days and practise my Spanish. 

> #### "Travelling by train is a wonderful way to experience Europe." 

When you get on a plane you're plonked down at your destination with no appreciation for the distance you've travelled or countries you've passed through. By rail, you feel every moment and it's a much bigger adventure!
