INTRO:

*Hi there listeners, and thanks for joining us for this month's podcast. We’re really excited to be talking to Kate Rawles, an author and adventurer who uses her adventures to be an ambassador for the environment. In 2006, Kate cycled the length of the Rocky mountains from Texas to Alaska, a journey called the ‘Carbon Cycle’ in which she explored North American attitudes towards climate change. Then in 2016, she undertook the Life Cycle, which was an exploration of biodiversity along the Andes mountain range in South America, cycling more than 8000 miles from Colombia to Cape Horn. We started by asking Kate what her motivations were and why she came up with the idea of what she calls ‘Adventure Plus’*



Kate Rawles. Become increasingly interested in the idea of ‘Adventure Plus’, grew out of a concern of the chasm between what the scientists are telling us about climate change and other environmental crises, and any meaningful action on the ground. The other part is that I love having adventures and love riding my bike in mountains.

I was working as a University lecturer teaching my students about this stuff, but I wondered if I could combine these two passions as a way to reach wider audiences. Using adventurous journeys to raise awareness and inspire action on some of our biggest environmental challenges.



First AP trip was Carbon Cycle in 2006, cycling from Texas to Alaska following the Rockies, talking to people about climate change in the belly of the oil beast. This was at the height of the Bush administration so it was an interesting time to be talking about climate change. Brought her stories back to the UK, turned it into a slideshow, wrote a book, the Carbon Cycle, and using the adventure as a communication hook, gave talks to loads of different audiences about climate change and what we can do about it.



*Kate’s book, the Carbon Cycle, is a great read and highly recommended, though currently out of print, so if you'd like a copy you can contact Kate via her website,*[outdoorphilosophy.co.uk](http://outdoorphilosophy.co.uk)

*But though this journey was all about climate change, that’s only part of the picture in terms of the environmental challenges we face. Kate explains.*



10 years later I was still giving the carbon cycle slide show, and it dawned on me I was really onto something – combining adventure and big environmental issues was working. and I was also noticing that the climate change agenda was getting loads of attention which is great, but it was starting to eclipse other environmental issues, particularly biodiversity loss. We are wiping out species at around 1000 times faster than the background rate of extinction. The UN said recently about 1 million species are heading for extinction, and we've lost around 60% of our wild animal populations in less than my lifetime. Scientists are saying that biodiversity and the ecosystem crisis is every bit as challenging to us as climate change, but it's getting much less attention and less press, even though the two are intertwined.



Paul Erlich came up a neat equation, which is environmental impact = population x consumption xtechnology. Basically saying that our impact is because of how many of us there are, and what we understand by quality of life, which at the moment is very high-consumer and materialistic, and the impacts that we are seeing are a side effect of our growth-based economics and our growth-based approach to life in general. The impacts are: climate change, biodiversity loss, and the shocking amount of plastic pollution and other kinds of pollution. They all have a common root and are interconnected. E.g. if you lose trees, you’re losing biodiversity as well as a carbon sink.



There’s a danger that a lot of the language around environmental crisis is the language of climate change, and while that’s a hugely important emergency, if we only talk about that and don’t link it to the ecological and biodiversity emergency then that becomes dangerous. E.g. so-called solutions to climate change can be very bad for biodiversity. An obvious example is using bio fuel rather than fossil fuel to power transport, but then you’re clearing lush, very bio-diverse areas, to grow monocultures of palm oil etc which is a biodiversity catastrophe. So we have to talk about climate change and the ecological emergency. It’s all linked.



*We’re really pleased that Kate is one of the people to have signed our pledge not to fly in 2020. But we’re quite careful not to say you can never fly again – taking a year off is about starting the conversation and changing the mindset away from jumping on a flight without thinking. The way Kate has done it is allowed herself one flight every three years, and she explains how she came to that decision.*



When I did the Carbon Cycle journey I flew across the Atlantic. At the time, I justified it by saying I’m going for three months, when I'm there I’m only going to ride my bicycle, and I'm doing it for climate change reasons. And I was a bit shocked when I found out, embarrassingly some months later, that mindset is the problem. I was saying that my flight is special, mine is important. After that decided not to completely quit flying but I would put myself on a flight ration, since 2006have flown no more than once every three years, and interestingly when I'm talking about climate change and my approach, I find people pay attention to that idea, that it’s not absolute – many people aren't prepared to quit flying for many reasons e.g. family or work, but they could contemplate flying less. So I’m on one every three years and invite my audiences to think about also going on a self-imposed flying ration. Even if you can’t give it up completely.



*So bearing in mind that ration, we asked Kate how she crossed the ocean for her second transatlantic cycling adventure?*



When I went across the Atlantic for my next adventure, not only was it a non-flying year, I was also very keen to do the journey with as little environmental impact as possible. It troubles me that the adventure and outdoors world often blanks out the problems around flying – a lot of it is about climbing mountains on every continent, or trips of that kind, and in the adventure community we’re not really yet having an open and honest conversation about the impacts of that and the problems of flying and other impacts. I’m not saying we shouldn’t be doing it but we really need that conversation to be had. Most adventurers are in love with the planet yet we’re having a big impact. Let’s open up that conversation and see what we can do there that's positive, because there’s loads that positive about adventure.



So I wanted to keep my impact down as low as possible, but I also really wanted to go to South America, because I wanted to focus on biodiversity and I love cycling in mountains, and where can you get both of those things in spades but in S America? I decided the best way to get there was on a cargo ship. Mike Berners Lee who’s a carbon footprint specialist did the number crunching, and worked out that had I gone by plane the carbon footprint would have been roughly 2 tonnes CO2 equivalent. By contrast, per passenger for the cargo ship it’s 50kg. A huge, huge saving, and a fascinating way to travel.



It took 11 days from France to Colombia, and a month on the return leg, coming up the west coast of SA then through the Panama canal and across the Atlantic. So a very interesting way of travelling. It’s a fantastic way to travel because it gives you time to change gear, both on the way there, and on the way back. Of course, you need time and money to travel in this way, but I would wholeheartedly recommend it.





*And this is exactly what we've heard from other cargo ship travellers, such as Christine and Peter who wrote for our blog about their journey back from Singapore by cargo ship. They put it really nicely: had we flown, our bodies would have arrived home before our brains. So it's not just about the environmental benefit, it can also be very worthwhile for us as travellers. Learning about how the world connects. An experience you will never forget. Truly unique, unlike a flight. Did you have ‘wow’ moments?*



There are many ‘wow’ moments from the cargo ship. On the way there I was travelling from east to west, and one of the things about that was that every day you get an extra hours’ sleep which was wonderful, and it gets warmer! I left France when it was freezing, and every day it gets a bit warmer and eventually it gets very warm, and every day I was on deck watching the flying fish, and the other thing that is incredibly impactful is realising the size of the ocean. We know how much of the earth is covered in ocean, but when you're on it and travelling for days and days without seeing land, that drives home what that means.



*\*But cargo ships aren’t necessarily green…*



The thing about the cargo ship is that it is a bit of a paradox – while, per passenger mile, it’s a drastic reduction in emissions, the cargo industry has a bigger footprint than aviation because there are so many ships out there running on such bad fuel. Coming into port and seeing acres of these containers, constantly going off ships, on ships, onto trucks, off somewhere else, you realise very quickly how crazy the current system is and how much stuff is constantly in motion around the world, most of which we don’t actually need, but it's fundamental to our growth system.



*OK, so on to the actual concept of travel. Hitching a lift on a cargo ship is not going to suit everybody. Cabin availability is low, it's quite expensive, and obviously for holiday purposes it would just take up too much time. The vast majority of people crossing the Atlantic do so by plane. So do we need to completely reconsider travel? The Americas are a long way away, across a huge ocean – what does this mean for those of us who want to go there?*



We have to put the whole concept of travel, especially holiday travel, firmly into context and perspective. We’re talking about a major climate change and ecological emergency. We’re talking about a serious threat to human civilisation as we currently understand it and a serious threat to many other forms of life on earth who are every bit as entitled to be here as we are, and who we utterly depend on. This is the key things about biodiversity – it's not luxury, or nice to have, it’s our life support system! For example, we are all solar powered! We depend on the sun’s energy for food, but we can't access that unless we have plants. Everything eats plants or things that eat plants – that’s where we get our energy. We cannot live without biodiversity yet we’re currently decimating it. And we all know the stats about climate change. We’re talking about major crises here, and that’s the context within which we have to put our travelling and our holiday plans. Most people will not be able to cross the Atlantic on a cargo ship – I will never be able to do that again in my lifetime. I have many friends in the USA and I just won’t see them regularly, and that's how it is. We can turn this into a positive by celebrating where we do live and going on holiday more locally, travelling by train and bike. When I cut back on flying I spent a lot more time sea kayaking in Scotland instead. Scotland is a hard place to beat for sea kayaking! There’s no easy way around it. We can’t just go to NY for our hen nights and stag dos any longer – that just isn’t the world we live in any more. And it’s tragic – I feel cheated in a way, that just as the cheap flight world is opening up travel for people like me who love travel, I was learning about climate change and realising that I couldn’t justify that kind of behaviour. So it's about perspective: my holiday plans and desires can't possibly take priority over the future of life on earth.



*This is a hard sell – people are reluctant to hear this. We want to protect our lifestyles and have our holidays in the Caribbean. We forget how relatively recent it is that we live in this globalised society. Now it's so easy to travel long distances relatively cheaply, we forget what that means, not just in terms of emissions but in terms of relationships and the practicalities of making our planet so artificially small.*



It is a hard sell but it’s fundamentally important to be honest about what we’re up against and the scale of the challenge. We need to reduce emissions by 80% really quickly. We have to make cuts and that's all there is to it. But there also needs to be fairness in the process. It has to be a just transition from fossil fuels to a very different economy and energy system. That includes access to travel. There's a myth that cheap flights are accessed by those with less money, but actually most people in the UK still don’t fly – flying is still a huge privilege.



*So what does a life with less flying look like? Isn’t it just, well, boring? Kate’s keen to communicate that it's win-win all round.*



One of the things you learn cycle touring is that if you appreciate the basics, and really get joy from a hot shower and a cup of coffee, and a decent meal and you don't need a lot more, that’s the secret to happiness and to sustainability. And there are so many win-wins. So much of modern life is stressful and we have too much stuff and we are too busy and we have money we haven’t got time to spend – there’s a lot of stress and unhappiness in modern life. There are ways in which we could have a higher quality of life, albeit differently understood – much more about time with each other, with our friends, with our communities, with nature, and have positive experiences rather than quantities of stuff, we could have a better quality of life, for all of us, with a much lower carbon and other environmental footprint. And what’s not to like about that? The current model is failing. It’s a disaster socially as well as a disaster environmentally, and we need to get smart and move beyond it, and we can do that. It’s very clear that the solutions are out there. We know how to reconstruct the transport system and the food system and the energy system to make it clean and more equitable and less impactful. We just need to crack on and do it.



*Now to the final question about this future vision of transatlantic travel. As we’ve said, on a per-passenger basis, cargo ship is far lower in emissions, but it’s not a solution because it's part of a highly polluting industry, and it's expensive and it’s not going to be for everybody, but what if we were to have this idea of flotillas of white-sailed ships coming in to harbour in New York, having set sail from Southampton. Is that an option? Some people think so. Is that what will happen in the future? When we’ve all woken up and realised what we need to do? Is this the way we will now be travelling across the Atlantic?*



I would love to think that was the future – wouldn’t that be wonderful? Sailing ships are amazing. They are almost as amazing as bicycles as a form of low emission transport. The bicycle is supposed to be the most efficient way of moving a human being from A to B. 10 miles per peanut on a flat road without a headwind! But a sailing ship must come a close second. To move people around the world using the power of the wind is a fantastic vision and it's not just a vision it’s a fantastic reality and good luck to those entrepreneurs who are thinking about trying to upscale the current provision, because it’s definitely possible to have sailing craft, and it's not that long ago that sailing ships were humans’ main way of travelling around the world – we forget how recent our industrialised history is, in the context of the wider history of humanity. So yes, an increase in sailing. It’s not going to be the equivalent of the jumbo jet bus in the sky, because it is always going to take longer and be more limited in terms of availability, but that's going to be part of a bigger social change. We are going to have to travel less in the future and enjoy where we are more, and spend more time exploring close to home. and certainly my next journeys are going to be within the UK and Europe and I’m really looking forward to that.
