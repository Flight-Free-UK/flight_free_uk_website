### **In 2016 I set up the [Sheffield Environmental Movement](http://www.semcharity.org.uk/) (SEM) to help reconnect people from minority communities with the natural environment.**

I had previously co-founded the 100 Black Men Walk for Health Group in 2004. The name is taken from the Million Man March civil rights protest in America where people walked to demand economic and social justice. In our case, it is about middle-aged Black men having the freedom to roam in outdoor spaces. 

#### We walk for health and wellbeing as well as for leisure and recreation.

I suppose the Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated how important access to nature is for our health and wellbeing. The pandemic has particularly impacted minority communities who tend to live in poor-quality local environments. The groups I work with have limited exposure and information about what is out there in Britain. 

> #### "It's possible to find adventure and have exciting experiences here in the UK without having to fly halfway around the world, but people will only travel locally if they feel a sense of belonging."

Where people experience racism or are not made to feel a sense of belonging, or be treated like strangers in their own country, this will discourage them from wanting to visit, revisit or recommend to friends and families to visit.

People will always fly. There is no way to stop this, but we can educate people to understand the impact of their carbon footprint and how to reduce it, by living responsible lives and to live as if nature mattered. Our very lives depend on nature!

It is important to educate people about the climate-friendly travel options that are available, and also provide alternatives. 

> #### "The airline industry is so powerful. But consumers have the power to lobby the airline industry to reduce carbon emissions."

I think the state of our planet is at risk. Every day we are witnessing changes in weather patterns which are impacting on peopleâ€™s health and wellbeing as well as livelihoods and ecosystems. We are living in the era of the Anthropocene. 

There is a need for concerted action by Government and industry, but we also need active citizens and environmental stewards to work together locally, nationally and globally to raise awareness about the pending disaster facing humanity as a whole.

### Nature is no respecter of race, class or status; we are all in this together. My passion and desire as an Ecocentrist is to contribute to the welfare of our planet and the species of which we are part.
