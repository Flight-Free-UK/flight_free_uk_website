### A lot of people imagine that there’s a big and growing demand for business flights.

##### Yet if you look at the stats, business travel in the UK has been pretty much flatlining for a decade, even pre-Covid, and even before the uptick in climate concern.

In the UK, business trips make up about 10% of all visits abroad. The number has only grown slightly since 1999 and actually fell in 2019. Even at Heathrow, which has traditionally been seen as a business hub (and uses growth in business flights as an argument for expansion and a third runway), there are twice as many passengers travelling for leisure as for business, and the growth in air travel and growth in emissions has mostly come from leisure.

### So why do we think that business flights are the problem?

Everyone knows someone who flies for business. We compare their frequent trips abroad to our own annual holiday. But actually, people who work in jobs that require air travel make up a very small proportion of the UK population. The holiday market is much, much larger. Still, advertising and other narratives lead us to believe that business flyers are the problem.

### R﻿eduction of business flights during Covid

A﻿t the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s estimated that business travel fell by 70-90%. Many people have the view that, because of the shift to online working during Covid, a lot of business travel is now seen as unnecessary and won't return.

O﻿nline working has several benefits: it is logistically easier to bring people together for meetings, especially those who live in different areas. [Studies show](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01190-9) that the number of meetings per person increased during the first Covid lockdown, and the number of people attending meetings increased, but the overall meeting time went down, suggesting that online meetings are a more inclusive and time-efficient way to conduct business. Efficiency and inclusivity are major advantages for businesses.

I﻿n addition, replacing in-person meetings with online meetings is less expensive, as it eliminates the need for travel, catering and venue hire. Saving money is a big motivating factor for businesses. Reducing travel time and time away from family is good for well-being – another advantage for businesses looking to take care of their staff and create a positive working culture.

F﻿inally, 

### Secondly, businesses are starting to take the climate crisis seriously.

We were talking about the climate crisis long before we were talking about the health crisis of Covid-19. There is lots of evidence that people’s concern about climate change has not been impacted by the pandemic – it remains high. So Big Business in particular is feeling the pressure to come out with a net zero strategy. If emissions from buildings and workplaces are being cut, business travel will stand out as a problem area.

For example, the [accountancy firm EY](https://www.ey.com/en_uk/news/2021/01/ey-announces-ambition-to-be-carbon-negative-in-2021) has committed to cut its whole company emissions to net zero by 2025, and reduce business travel emissions by 35%.  EY has 300,00 employees in over 150 countries, so that’s significant. 

Up till now, companies have been relying on offsetting. There’s been a realisation that they’re going to have to do a lot better than that in future. 

> "Companies have been relying on offsetting. There’s been a realisation they’re going to have to do a lot better in future. "

Post-recession, we saw that the people in charge of the pursestrings were looking to cut flights for financial reasons. The conversation has moved on from there and employees are now expecting their firms to come out with climate commitments.

### This reduction in business flights might be good for the climate, and for businesses and their employees, but what about the airlines?

On average, business and first-class tickets are five times the price of an economy seat, and many airlines rely on that revenue in order to offer low prices for the rest of the seats. 

It’s the long-haul routes that have those premium seats available that are going to suffer. For transatlantic routes, 10% of tickets are for premium seats, and they make up 50% of the revenue. So you don’t need to lose many of those passengers before the profitability of that journey starts to come into question. So do you reduce the frequency of flights? Push up prices on other seats?

> "10% of tickets are for premium seats, and they make up 50% of the revenue."

There is speculation that as restrictions lift, there might be a price war among airlines which might result in some amazing deals for a time. But within a couple of years that could change. If there is going to be a reduction in business class seats, airlines will have to put up prices on other tickets to make those routes profitable.

In the short term, and even in the long term, this could reduce demand for transatlantic travel, as customers who have become accustomed to cheap tickets will no longer be able to afford to travel. We could therefore see an even greater drop in flight bookings.

### So how does this all impact upon the future of business travel?

There’s a [report by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20transport%20and%20logistics/our%20insights/the%20travel%20industry%20turned%20upside%20down%20insights%20analysis%20and%20actions%20for%20travel%20executives/the-travel-industry-turned-upside-down-insights-analysis-and-actions-for-travel-executives.pdf) predicting that trade events won’t happen any more. Travel within a company for training or for meetings is going to be decimated. 

People will stand back and say, “How many of those trips were beneficial to the business or to me?” If they were beneficial, could those benefits be delivered in other ways?  For example, if it was just to take a break or get away from the office, can we do that differently?

> "It’s dawning on people air travel is going to be problematic in terms of reaching our climate commitments." 

In the last year or so we’ve been forced to change our behaviour, and it looks likely that a lot of that will stick when it comes to business travel. We have been forced to act differently and form new habits. It’s also dawning on people that air travel is going to be problematic in terms of reaching our climate commitments. 

### With the coming together of the climate crisis and the global health emergency, if there ever was a moment to reset our expectations of business travel, surely it’s now.
