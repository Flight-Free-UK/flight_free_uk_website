## Get as much natural light as you can

Get outside as soon as you can in the morning. Walk to work, or if you work from home, have a walk around the neighbourhood before you start. Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, who is from Norway, says ‘You should have an early start with fresh daylight and fresh air. You should ideally go out for a small walk, I think it’s a really beneficial thing to do.’

Work out in the park instead of going to the gym.

Get more time outside by meeting a friend for a walk instead of coffee or a drink. 

Take a walk at lunchtime. 

Find the highest point in the area where you live. The higher you are, the more you can see the sky and the more light you will get.

Take an excursion to the seaside. Light reflecting off the sea maximises your exposure.

## Maximise indoor light

Put up your fairy lights when the clocks go back and leave them up until the end of January. Call them ‘winter lights’. 

A good reading lamp by your favourite chair takes the stress out of reading in winter.

Eat by candlelight, and turn down artificial lights in the evenings. Low light and candlelight can help you feel more relaxed, and you will sleep better.

Put a chair by a south-facing window and have a little sunbathe indoors.

## Keep warm

Knit yourself a hat.

Wear a padded jacket indoors, like they do in parts of China, and save money on heating. 

If you are sitting at a desk for much of the day, a hot-water bottle under the feet works wonders.

Get fingerless gloves or wrist warmers made from recycled cashmere from [Turtle Doves](https://www.turtle-doves.co.uk).

Have a hot lunch. A batch of vegetable soup made on Sunday can last all week.

## Enjoy some seasonal activities

Go skiing in Scotland.

Visit an art gallery. They have beautiful lighting, and the gift shops are ideal for Christmas presents.

Christmas markets in the UK range from tacky to enchanting. Some of the best are listed in [this Conde Nast Traveller article](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/christmas-markets-in-the-uk).

Download a night sky app for your phone and take advantage of being able to see the stars earlier in the day.

Visit a sauna. There are nordic-style saunas popping up around the UK, like [this one](https://www.aberpoeth.co.uk/) in Aberystwyth.

Visit one of the spa towns in the UK. At [Thermae Bath Spa](https://www.thermaebathspa.com/) you can soak in naturally warm spa water in a rooftop pool with a view of Bath Abbey. A beautiful place to watch the sunset. [](https://www.thermaebathspa.com/)

Be brave enough to try swimming in the sea, a lake or an unheated lido. It boosts your immune system, helps your circulation, relieves stress, and improves your mood. Just make sure you are doing it safely, as outlined with [these tips from the RNLI](https://rnli.org/safety/choose-your-activity/open-water-swimming#).

## Things to boost your mood and wellbeing 

It’s good to have something to look forward to. Book a show or a concert instead of a holiday and support our creative community.

[Give blood](https://www.blood.co.uk/). You will have a warm glow of altruism, and you get half an hour of people being very kind to you in a nice warm room, as well as a biscuit at the end. 

At South Pole Station in Antarctica the night lasts six months and the over-winter team of about forty people are isolated with only each other for company. They make sure there is a dinner or a celebration to look forward to at least once a week. Follow their example and take any excuse to dress up and party. 

The NHS recommends that everyone take [10 micrograms of vitamin D](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) a day during autumn and winter, when the sun is low and we tend to be more wrapped up when we do get outside.
