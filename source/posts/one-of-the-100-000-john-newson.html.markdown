## **Can you sum up what motivated you to sign the pledge?**

I know that flying is the biggest single action that a person takes that contributes to changing the atmosphere. It is carbon emitted in the wrong place, in the atmosphere.

## **How long have you been aware of climate issues?**

Since a Tornado hit my house in Birmingham in 2005

## **How often have you flown in the past?**

Two long haul flights in my life. I promised the earth not to fly in 2005

## **Only around 50% of the UK population actually flies, but most of the flights we do take are for leisure. What do you think would be the most effective thing in reducing them?**

Flights have to be rationed

## **How will being flight-free next year affect your life?**

I will not promise to visit faraway places and confine myself to one continent, Europe, and most likely to these islands 

## **Do you have any plans for holidays or travel?**

Ireland by sea

## **Is it daunting or exciting to have taken the pledge?**

It is confirming of my determination to take my responsibility to future seriously and act in accord with my understanding

## **What reaction do your friends and family have to you going flight free?**

I do tell people quietly, without preaching too much

## **What might you do to influence others to go flight free in 2020?**

Be an example and talk about journeys that do not involve flying
