## In this episode we are talking to Innes Fitzgerald, who refused to fly to Australia to take part in the world cross country championships, and Damian Hall, co-founder of Green Runners and author of We Can’t Run Away From This.



### Flight Free UK

Innes, tell us about deciding not to travel to Australia for the world cross country championships.

### Innes

I wrote a letter to British Athletics and told them I didn’t want to go because of the flight and the environmental consequences of that.

### Flight Free UK

How have you responded to the media attention? Has it been quite surprising that everybody is interested in your story?

### Innes

I was quite shocked originally! I wanted to share it because I wanted people to talk about it, but I was a bit overwhelmed by the fact that there were so many people who were sharing it. Most of them were supportive.

### Flight Free UK

Can you talk us through why you made this decision in the first place? 

### Innes

It was a really tough decision. I wanted to go to Australia but I couldn’t really justify going so it took me a while to work out how I was going to go about it. So I wrote the letter to British Athletics and that was kind of it!



### Flight Free UK

Have you always seen yourself as having a responsibility to reduce your emissions as much as possible?

### Innes

I’ve always been quite aware of the environment and I think that’s true of young people nowadays. I’ve been educated by my parents, so I’ve learned about the environmental impacts and that kind of led me to not want to fly at the moment. 

### Flight Free UK

What was British Athletics’ reaction? Did you get a response from them?

### Innes

I did get a reply but it was very short. It just said, OK, thank you, and that was kind of it. 

### Flight Free UK

Damian, you said you have been inspired by Innes. Can you explain why?

### Damian 

When I saw Innes story shared on social media, there were several of us sharing the story and saying how cool it was, especially because you are so young. I have a friend who also decided not to fly, and the response he got from the selectors was not sympathetic or encouraging. It was surprisingly unsupportive – it was really disappointing. 



For me and my friend we’ve got a lot less to lose by opting out of some things whereas for Innes it seems such a brave decision, which is reflected by the mainstream response it got. 

### Flight Free UK

Damian, you are also trying to cut down on your emissions for your own races. What is your policy when it comes down to flying for races?

### Damian

I used to fly almost around three times a year for international races and in 2019 actually I flew five times. Towards the end of that year I started thinking about my emissions, my footprint and my effect on the planet, and I haven’t flown since. 



So what I do now is I think, how important is that event or challenge that I might consider going to? How important is it really? I wrote a list and I scratched a few parts off, for example, there’s a race I’d love to do on the other side of India, but realistically there’s no way of getting there without two flights, so I’ve decided I’m never going to do that. So I narrowed my list down to two or three things globally that I really want to do. 



The next question is what’s the lowest carbon way you can get there? For example, I used to fly to the Ultra-trail du Mont Blanc, and now I get the train. I appreciate it does cost a little bit more and not everyone can do that, but I’ve got the train there twice and it was really easy. 



That’s my checklist that I go through now. So scratched a load of bucket list races off. But there are two or three left that I think I can justify to myself, as I’ve only got so many more years at doing this. There are two or three big things left. But I will still travel with unease. 

### Flight Free UK

Do you think there's a culture of flying that is particularly prevalent in athletics? Is it the same in other areas or is there a pressure to fly for athletes? 

### Damian

In my area of athletics, most of the glamourous races are abroad in the mountains, often in the Alps or the Dolomites or in America. Obviously social media is a big factor. You see these wonderful pictures of people running in these amazing mountains and it kind of feels like everybody’s travelling to run in the mountains. And I think a lot of us can do better than that. 



In a way, lockdown came at the right time. We couldn't travel and some of us got out in Britain. I feel like most of my running friends are travelling less and when they do, they are thinking about trains or getting together in a van or a car which is an improvement. I feel like in my area of the sport there is a cultural shift. 

### Innes

Yes I think that if you are a top athlete you are expected to fly. There’s also a lot about training at altitude, and you see that on social media. 



I don’t think that’s the only way. It’s not that I wouldn’t go at all but you have to question whether it’s actually beneficial. I think that it depends on the person and how their body is affected by altitude or not. In terms of racing there definitely is a pressure to fly even if it is indirectly. 

### Flight Free UK

Do you think that there are enough places in the UK for your racing that actually we don’t need to do all this world stuff we could focus much more on the local maybe keep those international events more infrequently? 

### Innes

There are a lot of locations in the UK for cross country events, and I run on a track in the summer. So in terms of competing in a country there’s no need to go abroad. It becomes more difficult if you are the top athlete and you want to compete against people who are at your level and the only people who are at your level are abroad. Then it becomes more challenging. 

### Flight Free UK

Innes, earlier in this season you took the train to one of your races. Can you tell us where that was and what the event was, and what it was like taking the train there?

### Innes

It was the Cross Country Championships in Turin in Italy. The rest of the team were flying, but I took the decision to go on the train with my Dad. I think travelling overnight with quite a few hours on the train took quite a lot out of me when I was racing. I didn't quite have what I would have had if I’d done it in the UK. But I’ve never flown so I might not have had that energy either by going on the plane! 

### Flight Free UK

Do you think that it would be easier if you were to do it again? Because now you’ve done it you might have a better idea of how to preserve your energy to make sure your performance is as good as it can be.

### Innes

The first time you go to a race you don’t know how to prepare yourself, so the first time you travel somewhere you don’t know how to prepare yourself. I’m only going to learn the more times I do it. 



### Flight Free UK

Damian, do you have any tips for Innes? What’s your experience been like? 

### Damian

Taking these ethical stances may compromise your performances and that makes it even more impressive that Innes has chosen to do that. It is interesting that you’ve never flown before. Although flying sounds relaxing, it isn’t necessarily – it’s often very cramped. There’s a lot of waiting around in airports, and I get dehydrated because they take your water away and I often forget to get some more. Your flight might only be two hours but actually you have to get to the airport 2/3 hours before that, so it’s not always that much smoother. 



Spread things out, allow time for delays, take breaks and take some of your own snacks rather than having to rely on what's on the trolley. I must admit that the first time I travelled to a race by train my race was terrible. I don’t think that was the factor as I had arrived a day earlier and had plenty of rest. But time to rest and time to recover by getting there a day earlier is definitely what I’d recommend. 



### Innes

We went to Belgium for a race a couple of weeks ago, so the whole team went on the Eurostar. The rest of the team was really surprised at how quick and smooth it was. They said it was so much easier than flying, which was encouraging. Because sometimes we don’t have a choice, it's what the team managers decide. Because I think more athletes would like to take the more environmental option if it was there. 

### Flight Free UK

Do you think there are specific things that the industry could do to encourage those low carbon travel options? 

### Innes

I think incentivising not flying would definitely help. It is not what the government’s doing right now. Sir David King said recently that he doesn’t think that athletes should be not allowed to fly, but that they should be given a carbon budget that they can use in their career. It showed that we shouldn’t be taking flying for granted but we shouldn’t cancel out flying completely. 

### Flight Free UK

Damian, in your book ‘We can't run away from this’, do you explore some of the things that could happen in the industry to make it a bit greener? 

### Damian

I started from an individual perspective of your average runner, and looked at what would be the biggest elements in their carbon footprint. Obviously travel is the biggest thing. Second it’s the emissions of our sportswear, and thirdly it is our diets.

Another area would be the events themselves. Over 90% of the footprint of the big city marathons such as the London Marathon and Paris Marathon comes down to their travel. And with things like football, you have the crowds and fan travel. I think sport on the whole is way behind the curve. There’s a lot to tackle and there’s some reluctance to ask the big questions.

### Flight Free UK

Finally, the big questions: Innes, for a runner of your standard, the Olympics is something that you must have somewhere in your head. And it’s a massive international event that will very likely require a flight. What’s your take on that? 

### Innes

Obviously the Olympics is the biggest dream and just to go would be the most amazing opportunity. I’d love to go but I can’t say how I’d behave at the moment. The carbon emissions that come from holding such huge events is just astronomical. We’ll have to wait and see what happens – that is my biggest dream.
