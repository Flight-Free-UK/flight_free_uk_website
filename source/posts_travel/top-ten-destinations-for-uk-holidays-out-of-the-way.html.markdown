#### Devizes, Wiltshire

Known as “Wiltshire’s hidden gem”, Devizes is a medieval market town with a plethora of shops, hotels, pubs and eateries. There’s a working Victorian [brewery](https://www.wadworth.co.uk/visitor-centre/) which runs tours and tastings, in addition to three ancient churches and two museums (including the award-winning [Wiltshire Museum](https://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/)).

Devizes is a perfect base from which to explore the surrounding area by foot, bicycle or public transport. For a unique and relaxing holiday experience, we recommend [hiring a narrowboat](https://www.abcboathire.com/our-routes/short-breaks/hilperton-marina/devizes-return) on the Kennet and Avon canal.

> For a unique and relaxing holiday experience, hire a narrowboat on the Kennet and Avon canal.

Not only is the canal a remarkable feat of engineering, with tunnels, aqueducts and the famous lock flight at [Caen Hill](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/places-to-visit/caen-hill-locks) (29 locks in a row!), floating at an average 5 mph is a truly relaxing way to pass the time. There are plenty of canalside pubs along the way; we particularly like the [Black Horse](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g528767-d5918051-Reviews-Black_Horse-Devizes_Wiltshire_England.html) at Devizes, near the top of the Caen Hill flight. 

T﻿here's no train station in Devizes but buses run from Pewsey (the nearest station).

#### Sheringham, Norfolk

The traditional seaside town of Sheringham is known for its beautiful sandy beach, heritage steam railway (the [North Norfolk Railway](https://www.nnrailway.co.uk/)), local produce (don’t miss the twice-weekly [market](http://visitsheringham.co.uk/listing/sheringham-open-air-market/)) and excellent coastal and countryside walking routes. 

Visit the countryside of Upper Sheringham (including [Sheringham Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sheringham-park)) to experience beautiful views of the North Norfolk coast, peaceful woodlands and uplands covered with miles of purple heather and yellow gorse. 

![](/images/uploads/norfolk_coast_path_canva.jpg "Norfolk coast path near Sheringham")

The Norfolk Coast Path runs through the majority of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; from Sheringham, try a six-mile circular [route](https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/out-and-about-in-norfolk/norfolk-trails/short-and-circular-walks/norfolk-coast-path) that traces the coast and then meanders through parkland, ancient oak woodland, fen and grassland in Beeston Common and the rhododendrons of Sheringham Park.

#### Edale, Peak District

#### Isles of Scilly, Cornwall

This enchanting archipelago off the toe of Cornwall is formed of five inhabited islands in addition to countless uninhabited ones, some of which remain completely undisturbed. Hop around each island on a “tripper” [boat](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/island-hopping), take a swim in the refreshing waters (don’t forget your [wetsuit](https://www.seatemperature.org/europe/united-kingdom/isles-of-scilly-july.htm)!), or [snorkel with the seals](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/experience/things-to-do/scilly-seal-snorkelling-p1148703) to truly experience this English paradise.

![](/images/uploads/st_marys_isles_of_scilly_canva.jpg "St Mary's, Isles of Scilly")

Each island offers a unique experience, but the Isles are well known for their creative communities, sweeping sea views, ancient architecture and fascinating wildlife. We’ve got to mention the [beaches](https://www.visitislesofscilly.com/explore/beaches) – with turquoise shallow waters, palm trees and pale, fine sand, there’s no need to go further afield. 

Scilly’s beaches are gorgeous enough to rival any in the world, and there are more than 35 across the archipelago. Head to Great Bay on St Martin’s (voted best beach in the UK) for swimming, Porth Loo Beach on St Mary’s for rock pooling, or Gimble Porth on Tresco for a beach all to yourself.

> With turquoise shallow waters, palm trees and pale, fine sand, there’s no need to go further afield.
