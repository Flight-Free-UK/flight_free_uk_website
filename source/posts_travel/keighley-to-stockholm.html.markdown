### For me, there is a fine line between my concerns about the impact of flying, and my desire to see and experience the world as air travel has allowed for the last 100 years.

##### However, this line becomes ever narrower as world leaders fail to make the decisions needed.

I now do not believe we have enough budget left to fly and produce meaningless carbon if we have the time and money to go by train. I think it is important to say that I have not ruled air travel out, but for trips where there is a choice, I choose land. 

This summer I was selected to attend a Great Britain orienteering training camp in Stockholm. Sweden is home to the best orienteering terrain in the world, and it was an opportunity I did not want to miss. All the other 20 athletes took the plane, but, after consulting the [Man in Seat 61](www.seat61.com/Sweden) to see what the route would be, I decided that I would not join them in the air.

Travelling overland meant that the ten-day long training camp turned into a two week holiday, with a rail taster at the start and end. It was daunting, at 17, to set off on my own for three nights across Europe, but, helped by my knowledge of languages, I headed to the station in Keighley (near Leeds) to board my train for London and beyond. With an A level in both French and Spanish, I can confidently have a conversation in them, which I found comforting knowing language barriers wouldn't be too much of an issue.

I took an evening train to London and stayed with family there having a relaxed meal, something I would never have done had I taken the plane. After a trip to the park in the morning, I jumped on the Eurostar to Brussels, which I explored that evening. I visited Manneken Pis, Grand Place, countless churches and the royal palace, as well as tasting Belgian fries and waffles. I stayed overnight in a hostel, and the next morning took the train to Cologne, then Hamburg. During my afternoon in Hamburg I explored the lake and shops, soaking up the summery European atmosphere.

That evening, I took the night train to Stockholm. I have taken the night train before, but never on my own, which was exciting and slightly daunting. I managed to sleep very well and felt completely safe, and it was incredible to wake up in a different country. The train was due to arrive in Stockholm just before 10am but there was a significant delay, so it didn’t get there until 2pm. I didn’t mind: it meant I was able to sleep in then spend several hours looking out of the window at the pristine Swedish scenery, as well as chat with the other girls in my couchette. 

Once in Stockholm, I met some family for lunch and a city tour, before meeting my friends at the training camp. They were all interested to hear about my journey, and some expressed interest in joining me if I did something similar again.

After 10 days of practice courses and orienteering races, a tourist trip to Grona Lund theme park, and lots of swimming, it was time for the return journey. This was via the same route, but without the city breaks it was much quicker: the overnight train from Stockholm to Hamburg was followed by trains to Cologne, Brussels and London, and I arrived back home in Keighley that night.

One of the best aspects of my journey were the people I met on the way. Besides seeing family, I met other travellers in Brussels, and on the night train, from across the world. The three friends I made on the Hamburg-Stockholm sleeper I saw later on for ‘Fika’ in Stockholm.  It was incredible that this chance encounter with like-minded strangers on a train allowed me to form links with others across Europe, people I would otherwise have never met. It gave me a taste of the different lifestyles, languages and cultures across Europe, yet also how friendships can form between people, just through a common language and choice of transport.

On my way south through Sweden I watched the sun setting over deserted lakes and endless forests, with tiny red Swedish cottages, all framed by the train window. It’s another experience that those who fly miss – the landscapes sliding past outside the window, and it was a much needed rest after such a busy fortnight.

My journey also gave me the opportunity to see the city of Brussels, Hamburg and Stockholm. As someone who normally prefers more rural holidays, it was perfect to spend a few hours in these places, knowing a more relaxing destination was waiting. Slow travel gives you a sense of distance, making me appreciate where I was to a greater extent, seeing the culture changing as I travelled east, another thing air travel removes from the old-fashioned definition of travelling.

I understand that people do not always have the time or money to choose this way of travelling, but I believe that it is far more enjoyable, and has helped me grow more independent and aware of European culture and issues. In a world that forgets the perfection of moving slowly, listening to people talking in unknown languages, meeting people you will never see again but have sparked a brief connection with, this sort of journey becomes ever more special and important.

It cost £451 (plus £24 for my night in Brussels), which is around £200 more than flying, although the extra 3 days of holiday and time in famous European cities mean that this money was well spent.
