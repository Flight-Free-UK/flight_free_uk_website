#### Exploring the North Coast 500 by Public Transport

The north coast of Scotland is one of the most beautiful parts of the UK, with its wild beaches, dramatic cliffs, and peaceful villages. Many people come here to enjoy the scenery, spot wildlife, and experience Highland hospitality. The area is rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. Whether you enjoy hiking, birdwatching, or simply relaxing in peaceful surroundings, you will find it here.

In recent years, the area has become more popular thanks to the advertising and promotion of the North Coast 500 – encouraging people to drive the coastal circuit around the far north of Scotland, starting and ending in Inverness. It has brought many new visitors, but it has also created some problems. Fortunately, there is another way to enjoy the north coast, and that is by using public transport.

#### The Impact of the North Coast 500

Since the North Coast 500 launched in 2015, tourism in the area has grown quickly. Many businesses have seen a boost, with more visitors staying in hotels, eating out, and booking activities. This has helped the local economy and created new jobs.

However, the route has also caused issues. The roads in the north are narrow and were not built for so much traffic. In the summer, some areas become very busy. There have been problems with speeding, littering, and parking. Some visitors are not used to driving on single-track roads, which can lead to accidents or damage.

While the North Coast 500 has brought many good things, it has also shown the need for more thoughtful and sustainable ways to travel.

#### How to Travel the Route by Public Transport

It is possible to explore much of the north coast without a car. You can use trains and buses to get around, and travelling this way can be part of the adventure. Travel by public transport is a style of slow tourism which takes local communities into account, making the travel a social part of the journey through providing opportunities for contact with residents and, at the same time, giving opportunity both to enjoy the views on many scenic routes and also to be active in selecting what to see and do.  

It is also about reducing travellers’ carbon footprint by avoiding rushing from one place to another, often in low occupancy vehicles.

H﻿ere is a suggested 12-day itinerary which allows time to explore some of the place along the route, as well as taking into account the restricted timetables of some of the options.

Y﻿ou can make your way to the start point of Inverness by direct train from Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth, Aberdeen and London Kings Cross, with connecting services from most other parts of the UK.
