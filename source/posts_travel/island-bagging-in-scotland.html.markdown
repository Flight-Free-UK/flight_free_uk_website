I’m taking a gamble by writing about this. The phrases ‘Pandora’s box’ and ‘genie out of the bottle’ are ringing in my ears as I type. Selfishly, I have all sorts of reasons not to advertise the Scottish islands any more than they have been already. Selflessly, there are further good reasons to press on.

I’m a thirty-something, lifelong resident of Edinburgh. I grew up regularly visiting the Isle of Arran with my family, typically in Spring or Autumn. I wasn’t old enough to realise how much I was falling in love with its natural, unspoilt environment, and slow pace of life. In the summer, we would typically fly off to France, Italy, the USA, or South Africa. These holidays created special memories, but honestly none of the places we visited overseas have resonated or invited me back in the same way as the Isle of Arran. 

Arran is obviously more easily accessible, but having been more than twenty times to an island only 20 miles long by 10 miles wide, I still have not encountered everything it has to offer. I adore its mountains, coastline, beaches, wildlife, and sense of community. All these things keep me going back as often as I can.

Lockdown increased my yearning for Arran but also got me intrigued as to what
secrets the rest of Scotland’s islands were holding. Something about not being
allowed to visit any of them made them even more alluring. I began ‘collecting’
islands once lockdown was lifted, and I’m now an avid Scottish-island-bagger (or
‘islomaniac’). I have taken my total to 40 as of June 2025.
