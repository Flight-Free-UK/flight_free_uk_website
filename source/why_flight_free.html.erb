    <p class="text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-6 sm:mb-16 leading-tight text-text-gray-light">Reducing our carbon footprints is vital in avoiding climate breakdown. There are lots of things we can do, like eating less meat, using renewable energy, or driving less. But did you know that just one flight can wipe out all those savings? Living sustainably whilst continuing to fly is impossible.</p>

    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-6">Reducing the amount you fly is the easiest way to make a meaningful reduction to your carbon footprint, and the good news is that there are lots of alternative ways to travel. With the whole of Europe on our doorstep, we have so many holiday destinations to choose from, and going overland can be a much more enjoyable experience.</p>
    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-6">Choosing not to fly can have an impact that goes beyond just reducing our own emissions. If lots of us do this together, we will make it normal not to fly, and show politicians and industry that people are ready for change.</p>
    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-6">Of course, flights have reduced significantly because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but we know that emissions will rebound once travel opens up again, and the climate progress we have been making will be lost. Meaningful climate action only comes when people choose to make changes – not when they’re forced to make them because of the pandemic.</p>
    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-10">More and more people are choosing not to fly for climate reasons. Could you join them?</p>
