  <p class="text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-12 xl:mb-16 leading-tight text-text-gray-light">Aviation is the fastest growing contributor to greenhouse gas emissions at a time when we desperately need to reduce them.</p>

  <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-6">Although aviation currently makes up less than 10% of global emissions, this is because most people in the world cannot afford to fly (the same people who will be hit first and hardest by climate breakdown).</p>
  <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-12 xl:mb-16">For those who can afford it, flying is often by far the single largest component of individual footprints. A return long-haul flight is roughly equivalent to driving for a year or eating a very meat-heavy diet. Living sustainably whilst continuing to fly is impossible.</p>

  <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-6">The good news is that stopping flying is often the easiest way to make a meaningful impact on preventing climate breakdown, and there are lots of alternative ways to travel.</p>
  <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-10">In Sweden, where Greta Thurnberg and youth climate protests have encouraged people to stop flying, there has already been an 8% reduction in demand for flights. When we come together, real change is possible.</p>
