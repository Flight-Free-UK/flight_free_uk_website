    <p class="text-2xl xl:text-3xl mb-12 xl:mb-16 leading-tight text-text-gray-light">Aviation is the fastest growing contributor to greenhouse gas emissions at a time when we desperately need to reduce them.</p>

    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-6">Although aviation currently makes up less than 5% of global emissions, this is because most people have never been on an aeroplane; the same people who will be hit first and hardest by climate breakdown.</p>
    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-12 xl:mb-16">For those who can afford it, flying can make up the single largest part of their carbon footprints. A return long-haul flight is roughly equivalent to driving for a year or eating a meat-heavy diet. Even if you take other measures to be environmentally friendly, one flight can wipe out those savings. Living sustainably whilst continuing to fly is impossible.</p>

    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-6">The good news is that reducing the amount you fly is the easiest way to make a meaningful reduction to your carbon footprint, and there are lots of alternative ways to travel.</p>
    <p class="text-lg xl:text-xl leading-tight mb-10">In Sweden, where the Flight Free campaign has been running the longest, and helped by Greta Thunberg and the Youth Climate strikes, there has already been an 8% reduction in demand for flights. When we come together, real change is possible.</p>
