        {
            "question": "Aviation is responsible for 2% of global emissions",
            "answer": "false",
            "reason": "This is widely quoted but it doesn't take into account non-CO2 warming effects and radiative forcing. The true figure is closer to 3.5% – but that’s only because less than 20% of the global population has ever been on a plane.",
        },

        {
            "question": "Flights for work and business make up the highest proportion of flights",
            "answer": "false",
            "reason": "Business flights make up only 10% of flights from the UK. The majority of flights (63%) are for holidays, with 25% for visits to family and friends.",
        },
        {
            "question": "I would save more CO<sub>2</sub> by stopping flying than by being vegan",
            "answer": "true",
            "reason": "Veganism is highly recommended as a way to cut your carbon footprint, but the amount of carbon you save by being vegan for a year could be cancelled out with just one flight.",
        },
        {
            "question": "We can solve the problem of aviation emissions with technology",
            "answer": "false",
            "reason": "Green techno-fixes such as electric flights, hydrogen and sustainable fuels might reduce emissions from aviation, but on their own they are not enough – especially as it is many years before low-carbon options for flying will be available.",
        },
        {
            "question": "If I buy a carbon offset I can fly carbon neutral",
            "answer": "false",
            "reason": "Carbon offset schemes aren't always effective, and they are unlikely to absorb all of the carbon from your flight – especially as there's no guarantee that the trees we plant today will still be here in 30 years' time.",
        }
